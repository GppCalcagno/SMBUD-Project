Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch."

There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.

It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.

It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.

I'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.<br /><br />The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed.

München|book|"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"

I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured ""food"" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great."

Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.

I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays ""NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS"" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays ""CAFFENE FREE"".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it."

The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.

The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.

It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!"

The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it.

I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something ""strawberry"" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively ""healthy"" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base."

They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies.

She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it.

Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get ""upset"" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.

I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste. I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.<br /><br />I have one more package of this to use and next time I'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more.

This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better.

I bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging, price and shipping.  The powder dissolves instantly.  Even in water!

This product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries, especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away.

Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!

My most recent purchase, however, was disappointing. The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1/4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes. I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a ""1"" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a ""51A""). Bottom line: their current product is not much better than much cheaper products. When they get a better crop, I'll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw."

I bought two bottles, which cost just under three dollars each. I fell in love instantly. The drink is delicious -- I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice, like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea. I am very sensitive to sucralose (Splenda) which is in so many energy drinks these days; I also hate the taste. I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done. No caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle.<br />It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so I started looking online for a bulk price.

It's hot enough that people who aren't used to it will say ""That's hot!"".<br /><br />Flavor: bright and forward.  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me, I guess earthy.  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth.  I don't like to go hotter than this because the sauces I've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot (this happens to me with Tabasco sauce, for example).<br /><br />A drawback is La Victoria doesn't make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria, nor do they sell them in [...] or Sam's Club.

I couldn't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.<br /><br />That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.<br /><br />If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. As a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable.

(A common problem in some fruit wines.)<br /><br />This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).<br /><br />For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid.

Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE"">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!"

They were mostly large pieces, re-hydrated well and had good flavor. I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.<br /><br />This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again. Highly recommend.

The others pale in flavor by comparison.  There are only seven ingredients in this sauce, including organic natural mint flavor.  In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch, chocolate chips, Oreo cookies, caramel et al, because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale.  Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesn't overpower the flavor of the ice cream. There are only 110 calories.  And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste, I use it sparingly, so this 15.5 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used.

Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water (approximately half a cup), it's not enough for a good cup of tea, so I use two. That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea. But it's a delicious after-dinner drink! I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box.

On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.

Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.

I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."

Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!"

MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.

From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected.

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""

I was depressed I was stuck with 4 bottles of this.  It sat on my shelf and I forgot about it.

I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream - IT TASTED AMAZING!!!  The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel.<br /><br />So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too.  I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it, it tasted fine.  Then I added ONE DROP of the oil, it is very strong, and stirred it in - IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER!  I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat.<br /><br />Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream.  It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it.  When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream.<br /><br />It is VERY potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting, if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch.

The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person (me) too long to drink it, letting it go flat.<br /><br />In any case, Vernor's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years, I think.  That imparts a great, unique flavor.<br /><br />I wish it would catch on again, and become available more widely.<br /><br />(Recently I did see it on sale in Redwood City in California's Bay Area, south of San Francisco.  The next day, it was gone!
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-8265-9_5046|Anti-monotone Constraints.|2018.0|0.0|||incollection|"I like ""Vernor's"", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is ""The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now"" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans."

I use Madhava's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.<br /><br />Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).<br /><br />Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy. However, I highly recommend it for baking. It makes everything moister.<br /><br />If you are looking for less caramel flavor, you'll need to use the light version of this product (equally good in all applications).

It's kind of generous to call it frosting, it has more the consistency of rubber cement. And since we were in a time crunch, we didn't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting, so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it. Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever. It spread about as easily as chewing gum, stuck to everything it came in contact with, and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it. On top of all this, it didn't even taste good. By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake. Our cake, which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey, was used as a centerpiece. A really ugly centerpiece, that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried.

There weren't large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans, which I've experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats. The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too, it's not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either, though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned, at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring. There is a mild ""spam""-like texture and taste to the meats(but way better than spam any day), almost a brine or something, that's why I heavily seasoned it. Don't plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats, it gave everything a slightly rancid, soury taste...no idea why! Due to the higher calories and higher price, I will only stock this as emergency food. I will buy more for that reason."

But it is not super-wonderful-better than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an Asian market.  The main value is as a unique gift.<br />  In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br />  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.

Now he puts it on many things. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised and liked it very much.

However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this ""Kona coffee"" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee.

The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.

Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I'm definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can't find a local store<br /><br />EDIT: Oct 11, 2012<br /><br />*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****<br /><br />So I decided to restock after I couldn't fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br /><br />Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn't ""terrible"" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received."

I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights"" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall's cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate's Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED)."

About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list.

I just can't find non-sweetened and non-dried cranberries even at the better food stores.<br /><br />Apples, carrots and turkey taste good to my 10-month old growing twin girls.  Babies love carrots since they're sweet to their taste, so that made a great addition.  The whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistency.<br /><br />The ingredients per the label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, mechanically separated organic turkey, organic whole barley flour.<br /><br />In addition to 12% protein and 50% vitamin A, it has 6% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through Earth's Best.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

Amazon has great prices (especially if you subscribe) and free delivery to your doorstop, which is convenient when you're a busy mom. My daughter doesn't like a lot of baby foods, but will eat this one. As other reviewers have stated, it's a bit runnier that other EB's stage 2 foods, so I add some oatmeal to it. It's also a bit bland, so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up. As an added bonus, it works wonders for her digestive tract! She had problems with constipation for about 2.5 months, sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository, and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time (I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber). I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken. I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein.

Before I bought this baby food, I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it, its like a dessert, yadda yadda yadda. The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else. Its a great product to enter proteins into baby's diet. The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also, baby will not choke on it. I highly recommend.

The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems.

For example, if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June ""use by"" date, it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you.  Since they're roasted in oil and unsalted, these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety, even if refrigerated upon receipt.<br /><br />Amazon doesn't seem to specify ""use by"" dates for the food products they sell, so it's a gamble for the purchaser.  I'm assuming that Amazon won't ship stuff that has ""expired"", but they probably ship out the oldest stock first, and the ""use by"" date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice."

I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much, it is rather expensive so I thought I would give this a try.  Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the taste.  I don't think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable.  I bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about $7.  That seemed a little high but I figured I would check online to find the best price.  As I started calculating all of the online prices, they are charging about $7 bucks for the 19 count.  I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper.  So you don't have to do the math...$7 / 38 = .184 per single.  Online price $27 / 114 = .236 (shipping not calculated in).  Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier, you can get a case of 12 boxes for $69, no sales tax and free shipping...sounds like a great deal??  12 x 19 = 228 singles so $69 / 228 = .302 per single - the most expensive at all.

While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.<br /><br />""Real"" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend ""time-to-mushiness."")  And certainly only the Kellog's product contains HFCS.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bob's Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I haven't tried Familia (but I'm not crazy about the idea of the ""fruit flakes""), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog's, but I'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.<br /><br />I'm surprised Quaker doesn't sell a muesli product...  Given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the U.S., you'd think it would be a natural fit for them."

I checked out their website, and for those of you who don't know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:<br /><br />""""Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press-induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes - to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures.""""<br /><br />Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as ""unadulterated"" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.<br /><br />I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.<br /><br />""""What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.""""<br /><br />If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br />-Amy<br /><br />PS. I used to be one of those ""organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?"" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my son's allergies and intollerances. There's more to it than ""oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it."" No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier. If you live healthier, even though it costs more, in the long term you're saving money because you are healthier. So that means less doctor visits, less expensive (and nasty harmful) medications, etc."

Regardless, these sugar cubes are my favorite sugar product.  I've tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on Amazon and in your grocery store, and none of them compare to the rich, sweet, unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by La Perruche.  Because I've tried so many brown sugar products, I believe the difference is the terroir, or the ground/land, where this sugar is grown.  La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and/or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.  I don't know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished, but the cubes are not regularly sized, but are large and irregularly shaped, and heavier/sturdier than ""cut"" cubes by other producers.<br /><br />The flavor is a rich, distinct and more molasses-y flavor than other brown sugar cubes, and is somewhat darker as well.  I wish I could describe the flavor better, but it has been several months since I was able to find a somewhat affordable supply.

Also, the Amazon description said it was made from ""Non-Genetically Modified Corn"". The label on the product that I ACTUALLY received does NOT say Rumford NATURALS, but it is still MADE WITH Non-Genetically Modified Corn. I say ""made with"" because this product now contains more than ONE ingredient. Its ingredients are: Cornstarch, Calcium Sulfate*, and ONE of the suggested servings (1 Tblsp) contains 15% of the ""Daily Value"" of CALCIUM. That makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation. ON THE OTHER HAND, for persons who must restrict their calcium intake (example, some persons with kidney stones), it can pose a potential problem, even danger. Amazon provides themselves with a nice ""out"" for this. They list the following: Legal Disclaimer: ""Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product."" BUT, IT IS NOT FAIR FOR AMAZON TO NOT AT LEAST LIST THE CORRECT INGREDIENTS AND PHOTO OF THE PACKAGE SO THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ORDER THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO ""READ LABELS"" AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED.<br /><br />I WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN:<br /> * because I don't need extra calcium<br /> * because I don't believe that the Calcium Sulfate was added out of interest in the consumer's health<br />  but to make the product cheaper to produce so it can be priced competitively with other brands<br />  and still be touted as having been made from/with Non-Genetically Modified Corn<br /> and just on principal because I can't afford to throw it away and did not want the hassle of returning it.<br /><br />I am very, very displeased with Amazon's incorrect listing of the product, which was brought to their attention when I purchased it in February 2012, and so far nothing has been done.<br /><br />*Although Calcium Sulfate is considered a safe food additive it is basically the same thing as Plaster of Paris. AND, if you use too much of this product (basically the same amount as I had previous used of pure CORN STARCH), the very stiff sediment in the bottom of the cooking container (I make pudding in Pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every 30 seconds) will remind you of damp plaster!"

It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects.

My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.)

Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing."" What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking, white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so, in my view, it's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties.<br /><br />This particular product, while it comes in tea bags, it's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety. Unlike the cheap teas, black, green, herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags, the 'Choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped, biodegradable, nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves, not some indistinct crushed powder.<br /><br />This being a white tea, 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong, bordering to overpowering for my taste. The Lychee and Osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste - think of sweet, green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma. If it's not 'love at the first sip', give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors. Or not.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />- organic, fair trade certified White Tea<br />- natural Lychee flavor<br />- organic Osmanthus flavor<br />- contains caffeine<br /><br />The somewhat off-balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer. Time will tell but at this time 3 stars (meaning 'it's Okay') seem to be the fair rating."

As good as the bag and the lingering scent on the envelope smelled, the tea proved to be rather bitter.  I may have steeped it too long, so will see if the bitterness abates steeping less.  However, as I prefer milk or cream products in flower teas, the bitterness was soon dispelled with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had.  Lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea.  I suspect the flowers added to this lychee tea may contribute to the bitterness in the straight tea.  Will definitely reorder.

The local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag, only the 3.5lbs and 12 lbs. This food is sealed very well, and is fresh. I have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food, and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats. This food does not ""rifle"" through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors (like cheapo cat food) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy. My cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old, and believe me, this 9 Lives brand and flavor are something they all like. The price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free.<br /><br />I also buy the Iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love. Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now.<br /><br />If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust.

I have to say that I was disappointed. It is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that I noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which I would charactize as ""modest"". My all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a St. Louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by Bissinger's Chocolate Company and they call it French Long Licorice. It is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sicky-sweet candy. I say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite ""type"" of licorice; this is important when reading reviews and purchasing. I was looking for something not American-style junk candy, with actual licorice extract not anise, chewy, lasting, with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones.<br /><br />As far a Bissinger's is concerned, they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production. It is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability (I can enjoy one for at least 15 minutes if I don't chew). These are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and I limit myself to 2 at a sitting for my ""fix""; okay, sometimes 3 if it is a superb book:D.<br />The last time I ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank-you for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because I do not live near one of their stores and unless I visit say St. Louis (where it is headquartered) I have to mail-order.Anyway, I prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when I get an order ($56 for 2lbs) I leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off. That makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference.

When summer is over and heirloom tomatoes no longer are available at the farmers market, these serve as an excellent reminder of the past season and a promise of the next. I originally bought these organic tomatoes for my stepfather, whose heart disease dictated a low sodium diet. And they are incredibly low in sodium. But I soon bought them for myself after I tried them just once. When the local organic grocery store and then Sprouts stopped carrying them, I turned to Amazon for a case. They are as much a staple in my pantry as olive oil.

As well, the text on the wrapper is fine- I wasn't repulsed by it and I'm not afraid to share. I'd only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating.<br />The colors are not as vivid as in the picture, and the lolipops are not glazed- so they do not have that shiny look that many others have. None of mine came broken, and they were well-wrapped. I'm happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all(minus the few that I share with friends), but I'd try something different next time.

I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.

https://doi.org/10.1109/COOPIS.1998.706179|Information Services for the Web: Building and Maintaining Domain Models.|1998.0|10.0|||inproceedings|I received 4 of these in my first ever Omaha Steaks order that I received today. I wasn't sure what to expect, but so far, I've been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients.

I was not sure what to expect ... The au gratin potatoes I had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce, and by the looks of them, this certainly wasn't it ... I opened the box and got out my skillet. The first thing that I noticed is that these things were huge ... like a gigantic tater tot. I browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each. To my surprise, they were very tasty. Texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh .. not frozen or freezer burned. I liked them alot. I think these are perfect for kids ... none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture ... I give these 4 stars.

I think the amount of ghee it is suggested you use (200 grams) is too much, and you can easily use 100 grams instead. Also, I think it's easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken (or vegetables) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying.<br /><br />To make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken, coconut milk for yogurt, and safflower or peanut oil for ghee.<br /><br />Overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani I've had outside of a restaurant, and even rivals some of them.

I don't feel bad about feeding these either because they are low calorie and without fillers.

That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!"

Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.<br /><br />Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models. Human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases LDL levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens.

These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!"
https://doi.org/10.1109/COOPIS.1997.613822|Poster on A Terminology Server for Cooperative Terminology Work.|1997.0|1.0|||inproceedings|I have mixed feelings about NuNaturals Nustevia White Stevia with Maltodextrin Powder and will probably not purchase it again.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use, but it is just 6.4 percent stevia and 93.6 percent maltodextrin filler.  In other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder.  In my opinion, this is unnecessarily dilute; however, it does make it exceptionally easy to measure.  If the labeling said 6.4% stevia extract, I would have passed on this from the beginning as I can get 70% dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia. If this is your first time buying stevia, go for it as it's easy to use and tastes great.  If you're accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts, you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this product's mixture.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- 5-star taste<br />- Easy to measure<br />- Perfect for first-time stevia users<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 6.4% stevia<br />- Not cost-competitive with 70% or pure dry stevia extracts<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Overall, a good product but not the best value.  I would given it 4 stars if the product labeling didn't try to hide the fact that it's just not very potent.  For about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of this product, you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low-cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead (or just use them full strength, which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia).<br /><br />In case you're wondering where I got the 6.4% (by mass) value from, this is how I calculated it.  On a precise scale, I found the density of this product to be 2.5 grams per teaspoon.  The label says it contains 40mg per 1/4 tsp.  Thus, 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder.  The concentration (mass) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6.4 percent by weight.  Pretty weak stuff, but still much sweeter than cane sugar.

Then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry. We went to stevia no calorie powder, after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects. The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste.

I am a caregiver for my diabetic dad, and once I discovered this product I was hooked, except that it is hard to find where I live. When I found it at Amazon I put it on auto ship so I don't run out.  The price has gone up a lot since I first found it on Amazon, however, it still costs more in stores if and when I can find it there. I make limeade with this which I keep on hand at all times. In a gallon container of water I add 1 cup of lime juice and 2tbsp. of stevia powder. It is refreshing and almost no calories and no chemical aftertaste.  My dad uses the stevia in his coffee and his oatmeal. I haven't tried cooking with it although I know they make one designed for baking, which I'll possibly try this winter.

The first morning I tried it in my coffee and hated it. It tastes just as bitter as Equal or Sweet n Low. I decided to give it another  try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious. I've also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea. So, I think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia. All in all I'm glad I bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go. I have tried many different brands of stevia but, so far this is the only one I have not thrown out. I also tried Truvia. Not a fan. It makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice!

I drink a lot of tea, and this is my sweetener.  A lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste, but this is the best that I have found to resolve that problem.  Highly recommended.

Not Nustevia!  Nustevia has absolutely NO bitterness, and tastes EXACTLY like real sugar!  It's amazing!  Add it to plain yogurt, you have an amazing guilt-free dessert, breakfast, side dish, snack.  Add it to tea, coffee, recipes, anything!  It is a truly magical product, and it is cheaper in the 12 oz container on Amazon than anywhere else!  They also sell it at GNC, but it is $10 for 4 oz.  Also, for drinks, I highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia, as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages (it eventually does dissolve, though).

NuStevia was a lucky discovery. It has virtually no bitter aftertase, it's all natural and I've been using it exclusively for more than a year now. It works in both hot and cold beverages and comes in bulk and in packets for portability.I haven't used it for baking and probably won't because the chemistry of most recipes depends on sugar or something similar to get a good effect. However, for daily use in beverages, this product is very good.

The product is a bit more concentrated and we are using less of the product in our drinks and cooking than other competitors.<br /><br />The deliveries are always quick and we have not had any issues at all with the product or packaging.

I have been on a low-carb diet for the last year and have lost 27 lbs, and NuStevia products were a big help with the success of my diet.  I love sweet things, and without them I don't think I'd have been able to stay on the low-carb diet.  I have been unable to eat sugar for a long, long while.  I had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave, but when I discovered they were not on the low-carb diet I'd switched to, I had to find something else to use as a substitute.  NuStevia products are what I chose.  I tried several other types of stevia, but NuStevia products seem to be the best so far.  The bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from NuStevia products.<br />NuStevia white stevia powder is super sweet, so you'll have to use it sparingly, and one bottle lasts a very long time.<br />I'm very happy with the product and will be buying it again and again.

Since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and I have a sweet tooth, I felt this was a safe alternative. Not only is it safer, but there's no aftertaste and doesn't raise your blood sugar level. This particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it. I've tried others before and since and there's no comparison.

If so, put this one in the middle of the pack.  It's not as good as the meatloaf or the meatballs/noodles in cream sauce.  It's better than the horribly taste-free chicken/dressing.  About even with the turkey.  Is that all I've tried?  I forget; but you get the point.  It's medium-Compleat.<br /><br />Are you just thinking about trying a Hormel Compleat for the first time?  OK, then just remember these reviews on Amazon -- particularly food reviews -- are all simply opinions of customers, no scientific analysis intended (I hope).<br /><br />Compleats are quick, easy (except for pulling the plastic off the top) and generally edible.  There's not a whole lot more to say about them.  I eat them because I'm an old guy living alone and too often I'm just lazy.  These do come in handy for a quick light meal.  ""Light"" depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy.<br /><br />This is a good one to lead off with if you're just now getting into Compleats.  Just note that, in my opinion, it's middle of the road for the line.  Not a lot of flavor; but goes down OK."

It's very salty but not lacking in chicken flavor. The texture of all of the ingredients is decent, neither too firm nor too mushy, except for the ratio of sauce to solid food being too saucy. Overall, I'd say it's fine in a pinch - these shelf-stable meals are easier to find than most - but if you have other options available, these are only fair-to-middlin'.

I've tried quite a few of the Hormel Compleats and this is one of my favorites.  Home cookin', it ain't, and it's a bit too salty, but for a satisfying meal in 90 seconds, it's hard to beat.  The only reason I've given this flavorful, decently chicken-filled dish 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rice is white.  We all know by now that whole grains are healthier, so, until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice, I'll mark them down.

That alone is tolerable though if only the meal wasn't swimming in sauce. This ends up being more like a soup than a rice meal which is an utter shame because everything else is fairly nice and the enormous amount of sauce ruins it.<br /><br />But it's very quick and easy to make and fills you up so even a blah meal like this fits the bill.

Ramen is a good lunch for me, being easy to make, cheap and versital. The Chicken flavor is one I remember but I havent had it in a long time, its one of the only flavors sold in stores where I live. I made some recently. Its better than I remember, salty but good. This is one of the more americanized flavors. I recommend NOT adding 2 cups of water. I added a bit more than 1 1/4 cup. and it was perfect. 1 1/4- 1 1/3 or 1 1/2 seems to be the perfect amount. I like eating it as a soup so I dont pour out the water. You can add things to Ramen like meat, eggs, or vegetarian protein and frozen veggies to make it a more filling meal or eat it plain. Or dont use the seasoning packet and add your own seasonings. Whatever you like. This is a great product, I recommend if you want easy, cheap lunches.

On these days, Dr. McDougall's products are lifesavers! I keep some fresh, washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes. Just microwave this one, for instance, while cutting up some broccoli, peppers, a carrot, and whatever else I have around (I also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day, cut in little ""twigs"" - delicous!) By the time you're through cutting, you'll have finished with cooking the soup and the soup's ""standing"" time will be almost over. (It needs a few minutes to thicken up.) Take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water, add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl, toss the veggies in the liquid, and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. When through, dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious, healthy meal. The men in my office come sniffing around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave -- several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan. When I am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in, I add a spring onion on top (I just use an office scissors to cut it.)

It's certainly better than Chef Bouyardee or Easy Mac or actual Cup of Noodles. I've only ever had one other Dr. McDougall's product which was the Tortilla Soup and I much preferred it. I found this one to be a bit bland. It was pretty much just dried Cup of Noodles type noodles with some peanutty powder and a few green onions. I think the peanut flavor could have been more pronounced and I wasn't crazy about the texture of the noodles. I guess I was hoping for a bit more than ramen with peanut sauce.<br /><br />I only gave this three stars because I thought it was a bit of a let down. I liked it but I didn't love it as much as I should have given my love of peanut sauce. I would maybe buy it again at a grocery store if it was on sale but I certainly don't see myself buying them in bulk from amazon. My go-to Desk Drawer food is still Annie Chun's Udon Noodle Soup Bowl. The calorie count is pretty similar (I think Annie Chun's is like 280 or so) but the texture of the noodles is far superior because they use the vacuum sealed pre-cooked noodles. However, if you're not in the mood for soup, these peanut noodles may be a better way to go after all.

I tried many brands, and have done many side by side tasting comparisons, and Cento San Marzano tomatoes have consistently won out. These tomatoes have a deep and rich flavor, and a nice acid to sugar balance (though you may need to enhance this when making a sauce). It's pretty obvious when you pull these tomatoes out of the can that they were picked at their ripest, due to their deep red color and soft texture. Many tomatoes advertise themselves as San Marzanos, but since SM is a type of tomato, they could have been grown anywhere. Not these. These are SM tomatoes grown in the San Marzano region of Italy, in volcanic soils perfect for growing tomatoes. I have no affiliation with Cento, I just love a perfect tomato sauce. Use these tomatoes, be sure to not cook the sauce for more than 15 minutes, and you'll see what I mean. Even using fresh, locally grown, in-season tomatoes I haven't been able to get the depth of flavor that I do with the Centos.

This cake and the chocolate cake mix also made by Namaste are our family's favorites.  This includes my husband and children who are not celiac and are VERY picky eaters!

As the only celiac in the crowd, I decided to wait until the others had tried it, before revealing that it was gluten free.  Everyone raved over the great taste!  The package included directions for making the mix into a carrot cake, which is how I served it.  My own two boys said it was the best cake I had ever made, including the traditional wheat flour cakes I sometimes make for the rest of my family.  It was moist, spicy, and rich.  It reminded me of the cakes my grandmother made when I was growing up, and she was a terrific cook.  I highly recommend this one!

Also their customer service is excellent! I needed to contact them and they were very responsive and also willing to do just about anything to make sure even ONE customer is happy - something lacking in most companies these days.<br />To compare - I tried a couple Jelly Belly licorice ones and to me they had a fruit flavor that was just wrong - not enough of a licorice taste.  Gimbal's is less expensive this way and superior in every aspect of a licorice jelly bean.  This is a LARGE quantity!! Keep that in mind when purchasing - either have a lot of jelly bean lovers in your life, or a large family or collection of friends to share with - unless of course your sweet tooth won't stop and then, just savor them all yourself ;-)<br />Enjoy!

With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!<br /><br />THEIR ANSWER<br /><br />Dear Dave,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Nature's One®.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic® formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.<br /><br />Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic® formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic® falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.<br />Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.<br /><br />The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic® formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic® formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.<br /><br />If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider.<br /><br />DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs<br /><br />Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.<br /><br />Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.<br /><br />However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.<br /><br />Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.<br /><br />The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.<br /><br /> (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, ""The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,"" Allergy 56; 5:403<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your interest in Baby's Only Organic® formulas. Please let me know if you have additional questions.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Lori<br />Nature's One Inc.<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />Toll Free [...]"

Sadly, my breast milk dried up so I had to fine a formula.  My poor son has so many GI, stomach, gas, crying, reflux, etc issues.  We were on Alimentum for over a month.  We even tried the ready to eat b/c I heard it was corn free.  I also tried the hypoallergenic version by Enfamel.  Nothing made him better.<br /><br />After researching DHA/ARA...I found some scary things.  Basically, it is made by using chemicals.  There are some babies that have had a horrible reaction to this b/c of the toxins.  You can google it.  Anyway, I found this organic formula that didn't have it in it (you can buy DHA/ARA seperate made from eggs organically and no chemicals).  I was nervous...b/c my son had so many issues...I didn't want to make it worse.  But I tried it!  Seriously, it has changed my son's life!  He is a completely different baby!  I no longer even give him acid reflux meds anymore...I mean of course it is still there...but that is how much better it is.  My son has been on this since he was 6 weeks.  I know it says toddler, but if you go to their site it is FDA approved for infants.  They say toddler b/c they fully support breast feeding for the first year.  It has the same cals, fats, nutrients, vit, minerals pretty much as the other leading brands...it's just organic...no DHA/ARA..and they don't use corn syrup.  Seriously, try this formula!

We had him 1st on Similac regular, then went to Similac Sensitive and finally to Similac Soy.  The soy did the trick. He was on similiac soy for the past 6 months. When the Similac recall went through, my wife became disgusted with Similac and suggested we try a new brand. I was reluctant but did so anyway.  We reminded ourselves that as babies get older, they become less fussy, less gassy and maybe they don't need SOY anymore if that's what they were used to. So I went to my local Whole Foods store and bought the Lactose Free Baby's only formula. AN instant hit !!!!! My son loves it ! Seriousely. He gobbles it down...all 6 oz in once shot. Before with the similac soy, he would have to take a break in between.  My wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy.  Well, if adults like it, I am sure babies would too !  I am very happy thus far with our choice. We were going to get Natures Best, but read that the way they extract their DHA is not ideal. Glad I realized that.  So far so good ! We always thought that our baby would be stuck with SOY formula...thank's to the similac recall and some good old fashioned parent intuition, we realized that is NOT the case.  I am happy about that since SOY can cause some hormonal problems.....babies and adults alike.  Thank you Baby's only for making an excellent product !

For my son, we were therefore very careful when it came time to picking out a formula to supplement breastmilk.  His stomach does react when I have accidentally had more dairy than I can tolerate so my pediatrician recommended a lactose free formula, especially given our Asian background.  I wanted something organic, not soy, lactose free, and with as clean of a label as possible and this formula fulfills all of those criteria.  My son didn't like it at first, but now he switches easily between breastmillk and formula.  He has not been gassy nor spit up on it.  I really wish Amazon stocked it.

If you're looking for authentic Thai, this will give you only half the flavor, so the name that it is only a taste of Thai is quite accurate. Cartons are fancy, but big for the amount they hold. It is definitely enough for a meal, but if you're looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat, you had better grab two. It is tasty enough for a meal, but if you can get yourself to an authentic Asian supermarket, I guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price (ie 6 boxes of noodles for $6) - and I'm not talking about Cup O' Noodles or things you find at American supermarkets. But overall, my husband and I, being the noodle-mongers that we are, did enjoy these as something new for the palate. However, we will probably opt to order Thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving.

I'd recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.<br /><br />Overall for the taste and quantity, the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal. Comparatively speaking in terms of price, Wal-Mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper (compared to the subscription price) but do not seem to carry the Coconut Ginger Variety.

I didn't really like this thing too much.  For starters, there is too much packaging for my liking.  Too many things to throw away.  And I agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.  Time to try a couple of the other brands of these things...

That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.<br /><br />Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.<br /><br />The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess.

For those of you scared of something spicy, you might use a little less, but for most, it's just right, and for those that like it spicier, you can add a little crushed red pepper. Since the coconut milk has to be added separately, you can also control the fat content--you can go light or go with the much yummier, creamy stuff. I find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang curries, and is maybe a little less spicy.

(I believe that with a dogs sense of smell they KNOW exactly what is in their food; however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them...just Google what is in most commercial dog foods, and you'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up...if a dog can detect cancer in a person, they can detect all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be eaten.) Anyway...I used to feed Purina lamb and rice to my dogs, but I was finding my young Porty was having trouble with it, and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish. So, I started making their food, and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe. The dogs loved my homemade dog food, and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again, but I didn't always have time to make their food. And, homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet. So, I started to research all the natural dog foods out there, compare costs etc. I arrived on Harmony Farms, and guess what...my dogs LOVE it just as much as they love my home made dog food. My young Porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great; my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more. Both have shiny coats and energy. No one can believe my old girl is 15 years old. I have told my friends about Harmony Farms dog food, and when they've switched over, they've reported similar positive results. My brother-in-law's dog had always been a very fussy eater, and had skin problems with a thinning coat. When they started to feed her Harmony Farms, she became an eager eater, more happy and outgoing, and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up (...I'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food, which I think was Iams). Other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now...and they had all been feeding their dogs premium, top of the line dogs foods AND paying top of the line prices. Harmony Farms products are very reasonably priced. Not the cheapest dog food on the shelf, but, in my opinion, you are buying the best quality food on the market, so it's an incredibly GOOD DEAL! It may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian's office. I and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs. :)

I switched her off immediately, hunted around on Amazon to find an all natural food and this fit the bill, shipping was free which was awesome and my dog LOVES the food, I worried about that b/c I've switched her before and she's been uninterested and I've had to top with gravy, etc.<br /><br />Do your research, it will blow your mind what your pets are eating in regular grocery store dog food, it's typically a high ratio of corn which is a filler.  If you want your pet to live a long and healthy life what they're ingesting should be high up on your list.  I'm glad to have the knowledge now and I really wish I'd looked more into this with my two other dogs years and years ago.

The food is excellent quality -- I bought this product based on its healthy ingredients; the dogs love it and I love Amazon for making it so easy to buy!<br /><br />July 2010 - one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease:  previously she had to have special food from my vet (Royal Canaan Duck & Potato for the past 4+years) -- She has tolerated, even thrived on, the Harmony Farms food w/o any problems. Each bag of Harmony Farms is about $20 cheaper than the Royal Canaan.  Hard to fight.  I am a believer.<br /><br />The canned food is great, too.<br /><br />September 2011 -- my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past (verified by surgery) has never felt better -- she is a wire and has the energy of a 2 yr old dog (she is 7); she is not on any daily medication.  This HEALTHY WEIGHT FORMULA has helped her to thrive.  Enough protein, not too much fat seem to do the trick. I highly recommend it.

BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her.

Our 8 month soft-coated wheaten terrier is sensitive to gluten, corn meal and other products generally found in the popular  brands.  We were preparing to take him to the vet at about 4 months old b/c he had great difficulty eliminating -- to the point of whining as he would attempt to go.  After more research on the breed we purchased Harmony Farms at a local store -- it was expensive but quickly resolved our puppy's digestive issues.  After 5-8 days on only Harmony Farms products our puppy was happy and healthy!<br /><br />I was so happy to find Harmony Farms on Amazon!  It is more economical AND delivered right to our door.  Our puppy, Connor, eats only Harmony Farms dog food and treats and is a much happier puppy now. Definitely recommend it for soft-coated wheaten terriers and other breeds that have difficulty digesting the popular brands.

With this, while switching from the Nutro Max, she had none of those problems. In fact, I only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks, and she didn't have any digestive problems. Both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective... several dollars cheaper at my local Wegman's and there are always coupons in the paper.

My boyfriend is an avid researcher, and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts - taste (the dogs love it), health-wise (it has healthy fats, and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn) and digestion-wise (the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food).  We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.  Now they jump when it's dinner time!  Our dogs are happy, very healthy, have shiny coats, and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food.  We get it on Subscribe and Save and we usually go through 1 bag p/ month - for reference, we have one 15lb Bichon and one Alaskan husky.

The first is 13 months and has a finicky stomach - if he eats too fast, drinks too fast, or eats anything out of his routine, he would bring it back up.

He would eat anything and everything if we let him. Within a day of both dogs being on Harmony Farms (No fasting, just a quick switch), both dogs digestive issues are gone. My oldest (the finicky eater) is healthily eating his meals without pause or hesitation. My youngest has solid, regular bathroom breaks and has been able to relax his water intake as a result.

These are a great healthier alternative for regular potato chips.  I love Special K cracker chips, but they only come in big bags.  I saw these and they are packaged the way I like (individual serving bags), so I gave them a try.  Now, I will never be without them!  They are sooooo good and there are a lot of chips in each bag.  Finally a good-tasting, healthier potato chip that I can enjoy!

I don't like real, greasy potato chips and prefer Baked Lays.  However if you do enjoy real, greasy potato chips, please see the review referencing Pringles and Steven Baldwin.  very funny.<br />Do buy these if you like an ocassional salty snack but don't want to devour a large bag of fat-filled chips.  Don't buy these if you are looking for a healthy alternative to chips - eat a banana or apple instead (and not those apple chips or banana chips because they are high in sugar).<br />If you do get the big box - just put it some place inconvenient like the basement where you will have to exert some energy in order to get them - and if you do, BONUS! you just exerted energy and maybe earned a chip or two.

I have ordered them twice and shared them with friends. We love the single serving 100 calorie packs. The treats are tasty and delicious. I am on an email list to alert me when the jalepemo flavored pop chips become available. Thanks Amazon! I am planning to order them again for snacks on a family vacation. The variety will make this a fun treat and when compared to other 100 calorie treats this product gets a 10/10 rating from our family.

I read the reviews and were impressed by them but, the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips I hated made me nervous. This was my first food order from amazon and I am glad I picked this product to be. I absolutely love these chips. I deiced on the variety pack to start with in case I didn't like one flavor had others I could eat. Turns out though I enjoy them all.<br /><br />They are thicker than your normal potato chip with a great crunch and more of an airy texture. One bag fills me up as a mid-day snack. The flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip. For me this was a good thing. I would have to say the bbq is my favorite. The flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it, the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end. My bags had very few broken chips in them. Everything about this order was great.<br /><br />My father was around when I was trying my first bag, making fun of them cause they were healthy. I offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect. He looked at me confused once he ate it, promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it. This is a man who HATES anything healthy, but shows how good the flavors are.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these again.

Don't expect a regular old, greasy potato chip, but DO expect something equally AWESOME that stands on its own. Popchips don't leave any funny residue in your mouth like some other ""diet"" chips, and they don't have a lot of fat and calories - only 100 cal. per single-serve bag! I got the variety pack, and liked every one of the six flavors - some better than others (because I'm not a big fan of cheddar chips by ANY maker, so these were as good as any), but all were good, most were GREAT. Even non-dieters who tried them liked them. It seems like they cost a bit more than the average bag of chips, but maybe that's because I had to buy a case. Even so, they're worth it if you're fighting the battle of the bulge and want a lo-cal indulgence you wouldn't otherwise be able to enjoy. My recommendation: EAT POPCHIPS!"

They are cooked in a kettle with pressure and heat. Fantastic. Not baked or fried. Made by the company POP CHIPS so it isn't frito lays or mars trying to forcefeed America in disguise.<br />-Packaging and Branding: Colorful and way too heavy-duty bags. This is why they are slightly expensive. Similar to kettle chips packaging. You will have fun opening the bags with a POP. Packaging was great. I've eaten about 6 of the small bags and not one was even slightly damaged.<br />-Taste and Texture: They are about the size of half-dollar coins, kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake, and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch. Definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the market.<br />-Nutrition: 100 Calories! Unfortunately, you know what this means. It's not a big grab by any means. It's about 15-20 chips per .8 oz bag. Which, honestly, is great for portion control. It's probably all we need and popchips knows it. Definitely more filling than other 100 calorie snacks made by, say, SnackWell or the oreos/mini muffins type.<br />-Flavor: The 3 pack comes with Cheddar Potato, Sea Salt and Vinegar, and Barbecue Potato. As an English major I'm inclined to take the ""potato"" off the label. Just as salty and flavorful as normal chips, but not overpowering like some (cheap tortilla chips/some doritos). NATURAL taste.<br />I bought these on sale with a 15-20% discount I believe. I might purchase them again if I won a gift card or something, but I would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some cash/trees on the gigantic box they come in. But if you are on the fence and worried about being disappointed, you won't be. This is definitely quality over quantity."

I'm on a mission to lose weight and these have replaced high calorie snacks.  I think I even like these better than regular chips!  The BBQ, Salt & Vinegar, and Cheddar are really good alone (and I'm not normally a BBQ chip person).  I tend to eat the Original, Sour Cream & Onion , and the Salt & Pepper with Laughing Cow Cheese as a dip.  I don't really care for the salt & pepper as much as the others because I don't really like pepper in general and these are very peppery.  I wish they would replace the salt & pepper with the parmesan garlic flavor.<br /><br />Also, I like to buy these small packages to limit my portion size, but also because there are a lot of chips in this one little bag.  It also makes it really convenient for me to grab a few bags and take them to work or throw a few in the car.  I don't have kids but the small bags would be nice for kids as well.

I was a little skeptical, at first, since I was trying to figure out how they were made if they weren't baked or fried, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried them.  This variety pack gives people a good opportunity to try the six different flavors and decide which ones are their favorite(s).

I do not consume copious amounts of potato chips, however, I do occasionally pack my kids lunch with the salty tubers. My family enjoys the Popchips so much, that I purchased a variety pack of 24 (0.8oz bags) from Amazon.  They taste very good and the texture is wonderful, although I will admit they are a bit salty.  I really enjoy the salt and pepper flavor the best, with the salt and vinegar coming in a close second.  Make sure you have a large glass of water as you are consuming these popped treats, because as I stated before they are quite salty. I highly recommend these for individuals who eat potato chips and want a somewhat more healthy alternative.

Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"". ""Wow!""."

I have a finicky stomach, and so I'm fine with things that taste low-fat and healthy, since those are mostly what I eat. But these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked, so I'm undecided on if I want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat. The all natural ingredients are what make this chip different, and what might bring me back for more. It's definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself, and see if you like them or not.

Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon.

However, I will talk about the product overall. It is very well packaged, the PopChips bags aren't flimsy or too loud. You don't have to worry much about these getting smashed while they're in a bag with heavier items. They hold their own. When trying new foods, snacks, flavors, I tend to purchase a variety pack so that I can sample everything. Let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, it's not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. My favorites are the Barbecue Potato and Cheddar Potato by far. Very realistic, savory flavors. Then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. The Sea Salt and Pepper Potato and the Sea Salt and Vinegar Potato are a bit strong at first and, if you don't like those flavors, I would say you wouldn't like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. Original Potato and Sour Cream and Onion Potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. I would not call this a ""diet"" chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. I saw a few complaints about the PopChips being ""too salty"" or ""high in sodium"". The chips can come across salty to a person who doesn't consume much salt but, per bag, these PopChips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. Overall, great buy. You just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is."

I was given a free bag at some event & found them to be tasty.  The single serve bags in the grocery store were $1 for a 0.8 oz bag.  Buy them from here and they are $21 for 24 1 oz bags. (Same amount of Weight Watchers points.) If you get two cases, shipping is free! Get them now before the states force the sales tax thing through!<br /><br />All of the flavors are really good.  I even liked the BBQ which I normally do not like in a chip. The cheddar have a good cheese taste and the salt'n'pepper have a kick. They do not leave a funny aftertaste or strange mouth coating like some of the other lower fat/calorie chips.

With Popchips single serve pouches, I can now feel good about snacking as each bag is only 100 calories. The single serve pouches also help in portion control. The larger bags are a slightly better value, but unless you have astounding self control, I would recommend the single serving option. They are that good! They easily stand up to any of the traditional fried chips I've ever had, and at half the fat and calories, how could you ask for anything more?<br /><br />The variety pack comes in 6 flavors: Original, Sour Cream and Onion, Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, Salt and Vinegar, and BBQ. My favorite flavors are Salt and Pepper and Cheddar. My least favorite is Salt and Vinegar, but I don't like ANY salt and vinegar flavored chip. My only wish is that this variety pack contained the Parmesan Garlic flavor which is VERY good, but extremely hard to find in local stores. I have ordered the Parmesan Garlic flavor in a 24 pack here on Amazon, but prefer the assortment that comes in the variety pack.<br /><br />At ~$17 after the subscribe and save discount, each bag costs only 70 cents. This is a bargain for these great tasting, healthy chips and I highly recommend you try them!

However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is ""sweet"" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account."

They have a distinct potato taste.<br /><br />The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple ""100 calorie"" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.<br /><br />My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.<br /><br />These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat.

First of all .8 oz. per bag equals about 15 or 16 chips per bag, which is not many. While this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories, fat or sodium, the fact is that .8 of an ounce is not much, and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time.  Due to the discounted price each bag was around $.55 each, not to bad until you figure that equals $10 per pound. At the regular price its about $16 per pound. As far as the taste, all of the flavors were good, none that I absolutely disliked, but none that really rocked my socks either. Bottom line, at the discounted price I paid I was not disappointed, but if I had paid the regular price for these I would have felt cheated.

The chip bags inside were pretty flat, there were no chips, but plenty of crumbs for any use you would need crumbs for. This is how many of the packages looked, flat. There were a few with edible chips, but not many. Not sure what to think of shipping chips in this type of a box, common sense should have been used??

They work well with weight watchers, taste great and the crunch can't be beat. This pack has many flavors, with the salt and vinegar being my favorite, my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddar.<br /><br />The one I miss is Sweet Potato. It is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors, but aren't included in this variety pack.

I cannot stay on a diet if I feel deprived. WW's website had a coupon for these pricey chips.  Never had a ""popped"" chip before, so I gave it a whirl.<br /><br />Wow, the best crunch and flavor of all reduced-calorie chips I have ever tried.  Better than other brands' popped chips I have tried since.  I need portion control help and these little bags for 3 points do it for me.  The variety pack helps to break up any monotony.  My favorite flavor is the BBQ.  I am not a vinegar kinda guy.  The Salt and Vinegar flavor tastes like feet to me.  Love the rest of the flavors.  I love salt, so the saltiness is just right for me.  Thank goodness my blood pressure is not an issue.  I need these snackies.<br /><br />Lost 30 pounds so far in 3 months eating these.

At least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices. This products is made of processed potato by-product and is natural by no means. The calorie savings isn't even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips. Also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil (if eaten in moderation) because of the healthy dose of balanced fats. In my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits. If you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip. If you feel these taste better than the above, then by all means enjoy, but don't be tricked into believing these are healthy at all.<br />Overall 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for the marketing scam that they are.

Well, they're fairly healthy: absolutely no oily residue on the hands and very light and airy. However, I just couldn't get over the taste, which I can only liken to slightly burnt popcorn. If that undercurrent of ""burnt"" flavor wasn't there, these might have been more palatable, but my taste buds kept zeroing in on that one aspect. Also, the seasonings weren't consistently strong. Cheddar was o.k. Bbq was probably the closest match to regular potato chips...the flavor was straight from a bag of Lays. However, I was very disappointed with the Sour Cream and Onion which was just too light in flavor and the Vinegar and Salt which didn't have as strong a tang as I would have liked.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these to someone who wanted to eat healthy and didn't mind a watered down version of a fried chip. However, I just couldn't stomach them. I gave away the unopened bags to coworkers (none of which were impressed either but they're not on diets...lucky dogs). For now, I'll stick with my baked goldfish and bunny crackers."

Junk food is delicious but it ain't good for you. Conversely, healthy food has a bad rep for being disgusting but I honestly think that it's just something that requires training and acclimatization.<br /><br />I really like PopChips. They don't taste absolutely amazing to be honest but if you're someone who is trying to kick junk food out of your diet, this is a good way to fulfill a craving without succumbing to unhealthier junk foods. Each bag is only 100 calories, which is very helpful for portion control.<br /><br />For me, the taste is great. It's not amazing but it isn't awful. Sure there are better tasting chips out there but how much more unhealthier are they?<br /><br />I've tried small bags of PopChips from the vending machine (which I recommend doing before you buy a case). I haven't tried all over the flavors until I bought the case and I was a little disappointed with half of the flavors in the box. Fortunately, my boyfriend and I disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors I don't like and vice versa. It works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually don't have the tastes. However, if you plan on consuming these bags on your own over time I can almost guarantee that there will be a couple flavors that you won't like and it might just be worth it if you just buy a couple bags of flavors you do like.<br /><br />If you're not accustomed to the taste of 'healthy' food, you might not enjoy these at first. Either way, pop chips are worth a try. Probably not by the case though. i recommend trying out a few flavors if you can find a small bag at the shop or vending machine before you buy a big box of them.

There are 6 different flavors of chips. 5 of them were really good. The last one though was not. The salt and vinegar ones were very vinegary and it was too bitter for our tastes. Maybe some people like it but not us. All in all though, they were mostly very good in both taste and caloric content.<br />I would definitely buy a box with the flavors that I wanted.
https://doi.org/10.1145/1416729.1416733|Web services: the story so far - an academic and industrial account.|2008.0|1.0|||inproceedings|This practically falls under the category of healthy snack - well, almost.  Single serving bags mean you won't be overeating and the fact that these aren't in anyway greasy because of the way they are made is a huge plus.  Nice crisp crunch.  The bags are filled with air, which for the most part do a good job of keeping the chips whole.  On the case that I got, though, two bags containted nothing but broken bits.  Of the rest most only had a couple of broken chips - some no broken ones at all.  I also noticed that you don't find nearly as much coating from flavoring on your fingers as I've experienced when eating other chips.<br /><br />Purchasing it by the case to try out all of the flavors is a good idea and a decent value.  Some of the flavors are incredibly strong, to the point that I don't like them, so I won't be ordering this mixed case again.  Salt and Pepper just tasted like pepper, making this a very hot tasting chip.  The Seasalt and Vinegar is really strong on the Vinegar, which is a taste I don't enjoy.  I love BBQ flavored chips, but again, this was kind of strong.  I probably wouldn't purchase the BBQ ones in the future, but wouldn't say no if someone offered them to me.  The Original is really bland compared to these others, but not bad.<br /><br />The ones I liked the most were the Sour Cream & Onion and the Cheddar, both with milder flavors.<br /><br />I'd give this 5 stars if I liked all of the flavors.  Definitely high marks for the type of chip and the size of the serving and the fact that you can try all of the flavors in one order.

I thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro. However, this is very poorly designed. I could not open it whats-or-ever, even after searching through reviews after reviews. Finally, my genius boyfriend found the solution! Basically, you will need to open it from the BOTTOM. You will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it. You will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there's water in the pot. If any one who is reading this still having problem opening it. Let me know. I'll try to explain it better there. But anyway, this is a pretty useless product for its productivity, but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own, and wants a prettier fridge. You can make you own with a cup (or any container) filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb....(so unless you have money to waste, don't buy this useless pot).

The little green plug barely stays in -- even after twisting it -- so the water is always sloshing out.  And the clear plastic cover is absolutely the worst design.  It is nearly impossible to remove and actually snapped into shards when I tried to open one of the pods.  (And I can attest that those plastic shards are sharp!)  If you are able to actually open the pod, be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom.  Even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs (which they don't really do), they would not be worth the aggravation or cost.  Like another reviewer said, just put your herbs in a cup with a little water in the bottom and a plastic bag covering the top.  Works perfectly and costs nothing.

For bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch, and it's difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on. Since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it. It works great for asparagus, but only for small-ish bunches and if the spears aren't too tall.<br /><br />More often than not I simply use a canning jar + 1/2"" of water with a plastic bag over the top, which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access. These pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag-topped-jar, however, and the clear front makes it harder to forget what's in there.<br /><br />They are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over.

Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly, the plastic plug at the back does NOT hold. A good idea, a nice-looking product, but poorly executed. Refrain from purchasing -- plastic bags are MUCH, much better.

We're both foodies, and try to cook like chefs in our homes.  I love this product.  I use this one for scallions/green onions which until recently always went bad before I could use all of them.  Sometimes I threw out more than 5, most times 2 or 3, but I honestly cannot remember the last time I used every single one.  That is, until now.  Inside the savor pod, they grow and keep for weeks (easily more than 3).  I am planning on buying the set of mini savor pods so I can actually use them for fresh herbs - storing my herbs in the same container as my onions is not a good idea.  The only drawback with this product is that the clear plastic cover is a little tricky to remove as others have mentioned, but wrestling with it is OK with me so long as I can use all my product before it goes bad.

The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there.

My review is not 2 stars instead of three.<br /><br />First off, as you can probably guess by the pictures, these are sour gummies.  That isn't said in the description.  Also, each one is about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide.<br /><br />Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.<br /><br />I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews/niece.  After all, they will eat anything sugar coated right?

I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.<br /><br />My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.<br /><br />I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.<br /><br />They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.<br /><br />I like the fact that these are low-fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It says, ""Treats Baked With Natural Peanut Butter."""

I have to say that I absolutely LOVE the flavor of these candies.  I am usually not a big candy eater, but I have to say that I was really impressed.  The Werther's Chewy Caramels were so richly flavored and chewy that I couldn't stop at just one (I usually stop at one for most other candies).  They have a great buttery flavor that makes my mouth water just thinking about them.  I like the fact that they have some great ingredients, like cream and butter, but I had to deduct one star for the fact that there are artificial flavors in them (I am an avid label reader and try to stay away from any artificial ingredients).  As far as the taste goes, my kids and my husband were constantly in the pantry looking to grab another candy, so I can confidently say these were a huge hit in our family.  It was also a great incentive for the kids to eat their vegetables at dinner- they certainly cleaned their plate to have a couple of caramels for dessert.  If you are having a party, these would be great set out in a candy dish.  There will be none left by the end!

I had never ordered any, but I came across a can of it in one of those outdoor,camping stores last Christmas.  I have been using it ever since to make my dieting harder, and can honestly say I have never enjoyed the struggle so much.  Pancake mixes are usually one of those things that usually I buy the cheapest I can find, or at least one that I am familiar with.  I tend to balk at higher priced mixes for the most part. But every now and then I get curious of a brand like this one. It just so happens that when I visited this camping store, I was getting ready to take a short hike as soon as the holidays were over, and pancake mix has always been one of my staple items to take along.  Unfortunately it wasn't 'till I left that I realized that this mix was not one of the ""just add water"" ones that we all know and love.  The best ones always needed your own addition of eggs, milk, butter, etc, and this one is no exception in that respect.  So instead of enjoying this mix on the trail, I have been making pancakes in the wilds of my very own kitchen.  I really don't know what it is about this mix that makes it so good, but it does indeed make some of the best and most delicious pancakes I have ever tasted from a mix.  They are very light, fluffy, and flavorful, and well worth the price and ingredients that you have to add yourself.  If you have a pancake fiend in your home, I would highly suggest you buy some of this great mix. Its cheaper here on Amazon than I paid for it and well worth it in my opinion. I have had lots of different kinds over the years, and this makes some truly delicious pancakes.... Highly recommended..."

The mix is almost foamy like when it is done mixing. The waffle recipe from the label asks for 2 Tbsp. of melted butter, which I never use that much when I use the Rob's Red Mill pancake mix. I could only make two perfect 7"" round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be 3-4 pancakes. The pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review. However, I also tasted a lot of chemicals in it. I guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient. Looking at the ingredient label did I realize it has more chemicals than other brands. And I do not understand what ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like Cinnamon and Apple, etc.<br /><br />In short, I am going back to my Rob's Red Mill brand, at least I know what I am digesting in my stomach."

Don't get me wrong, it's not bad but, you could find any number of ""mixes"" that taste just as well and some even better.  I know my taste buds aren't the same as yours so, what's just decent to me may be great to you.  I also wish I had bought just one can instead of 2 huge 33 ounce cans.  I finished the first can, I'll give the other can away and, I'll continue trying other mixes until I find the ""best mix"" out there.<br /><br />So far I seem to only be satisfied with a homemade mix for my waffles.  My preference is for waffles over pancakes but, this didn't make it on either count.  I even tried adding things to it but it didn't really help.  Maybe it's just me.  Try it if you like but remember, buy only one can just in case you're like me.  You can always buy more."

We have been trying to make homeade waffles for a while but when my second child was born, we got tired of all the mixing and measuring. We chose this batter mix because the reviews were so great. They take no time to mix. The dough comes out a bit runny but if you fill the bottom of the waffle iron completely, you get the fluffiest Belgian waffles. We are using the Chefman rotatable iron. I highly recommend this batter if you like waffles quick. You can add a little cinnamon and sugar too to spice it up.

Use 2 small bananas mashed, 3/4T cinammon, 1T vanilla, and 1/2 cup gratted pecans and then blend it all together.  You need to let it cook a much longer period of time at a lower then normal temperature and you need to cut back on the amount of water used. You need to know what the consistency of the waffle mixture should be before you attempt this recipe so that you can determine the amount of water to use.  This is a somewhat tricky recipe since it's easy for the waffles to stick and pull apart.  One banana makes it easier but I've had some success with three bananas.  Banana's are better overripe.

You have to add water, 1 egg, and melted butter for the waffle recipe.  We eat waffles about once a week.<br /><br />Apart from the fact that it tastes great (it has a little vanilla and malt mixed in), it has NO trans fat.  Some pancake/waffle mixes, such as Krustead's which also tastes really good, say they have no trans fat PER SERVING, but if it has partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in the ingredients, there is still some (less than than 1 percent) trans fat per serving.  Stonewall has none.<br /><br />We used to have a store that sold it locally, but now we don't so I am glad we can get it online.<br /><br />The can comes with a recipe that is perfect for making two belgian waffles with no leftover batter.<br /><br />We just bought the regular mix but we are going to try the other flavors next.

I have been on a search for the best pancake mix for about a year. I did not write this review prematurely as I wanted to give the product a fair chance.  I tried it with whole milk.  I tried it with buttermilk. I tried it with blueberries. I tried it without blueberries.  It is by far the WORST mix I have tried thus far.  The flavor is not good, seems like it needs more sugar.  With blueberries, it is very hard to get the pancakes to cook all the way through without overcooking them.  I really am telling you all the hype on this product has got to be from people that either work for the company lol or have never tried another high quality mix.  I honestly would rather eat pancakes from McDonalds.  Don't waste your money!  (Robbys mix is also wayyyyyyyyyy better and I believe it was cheaper).

The other day, found a big can at Sur La Tab store in San Francisco for only $10.95, so I thought, why not, this is my chance to try.  I was so looking fwd to Saturday morning and made it first thing today....all I can say is, underwhelming, nothing special.  I tried it following the instructions but using low fat milk and ""healthier"" butter, it was alright, but not great esp. considering the price.  Then I doctored it up a bit, added madagascar vanilla, flaxseed and psyllium which I usually do with my pancakes, tasted a bit better. Overall rating, 3 stars, just ok, stuck with the can so we'll eat it, but will not purchase again.  I will probably try it next time with full fat milk and butter as it recommended to see if that makes a difference, it probably does. I highly recommend Garvey's Organic Pancake Mix, also here in Amazon, tastes so much better and fluffier.  If you like 100% whole grain pancakes, we also love Kodiak Buttermilk mix, also here on Amazon...healthy, hearty and so good, even my kids love it...and best of all it's just add water, makes it portable, we even took it with us on vacay to Hawaii."

Furthermore, it is not available in our local super market whereas Bisquick is stocked. This will be a one time purchase for us.

That is when I discovered that he ""loves"" pancakes. I was aware that he liked waffles. (We've only been together almost five years!)  I, on the other hand, have never cared for pancakes.  I loved my Gram's waffles, but nothing she did could tempt me to eat pancakes, no amount of butter or slathering with strawberry jam could make a difference. I just didn't care for PANCAKES!  She did insist on teaching me how to make and cook them, because my Daddy enjoyed pancakes, so I learned.<br />I was in Central Market on Saturday when I ran into a co-worker and her husband.  They took me by the hand from the Baking Products isle to the Jams, Jelly, Syrup, Honey isle.  On the top shelf was ""the very best pancake mix"":  Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix. I saw the price and took a deep breath, it was twice the price of the mix I had just been contemplating purchasing. On their recommendation, I tossed it in the cart along with some ""real"" organic, light amber, maple syrup.<br />This morning, I fixed three small (3 inch diameter) pancakes for my man and one for myself just to taste. I needed to know!<br />Well, I don't believe I have ever had real maple syrup before in my life, just that sugar processed krapola sold as pancake syrup. I have NEVER liked that stuff!<br />That pancake with a tiny dribble of real maple syrup was DELICIOUS!

It appears that the two flavors out of stock were not substituted with two other flavors but instead a few more of the remaining flavors were tossed in the box. I had expected that when a limited edition coffee flavor such as Island Coconut was out of stock, it would be replaced with a different limited edition coffee flavor.  Same thing for the Half and Half Lemonade.<br />Second, the order was not balanced.  Of the 7 flavors I did receive, only 2 were coffees, the remaining 5 were teas.<br />The concept of a summer sampler set is a good one but the execution here was an epic fail.  The order is being returned today.

It is almost entirely iced drinks and this sampler pack had a good mix of the following:<br /><br />Southern Sweet Tea, Unsweetened Black Tea, Raspberry Sweet Tea, Peach Sweet Tea, Sweet Lemon Tea, Half & Half Tea and a few different iced coffee k-cups.  Additionally, there were a few seasonal Island Coconut which my husband loves.<br /><br />I would consider purchasing variety packs as my main source of k-cups, but at a price of over 90 cents a cup I can't justify the cost.

It tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package, for a fraction of the price. After receiving this, I understand why it costs less than the ""astronaut"" kind. The packaging stinks on ice.<br /><br />Normally, freeze dried items are packaged in air tight, foil type packages, so as to not permit light, and most importantly, air into the package. Air is the enemy of freeze dried items, because it contains moisture. The product arrives it is in an air tight can, which you need to open with a can opener. Inside, the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will NOT keep air out of the product.<br /><br />It gets worse. The paper wrappers are not only NOT air tight, but they are also ALL slit open. Every serving is slit open in several places. The can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible. This may or may not keep the product fresh, but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can.<br /><br />With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion. You MUST do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving, or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream. So be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product."

Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free. If your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store.

We Are Adding a Process...|2006.0|9.0|||inproceedings|"I switched to Merrick dog food several years ago (2007) when all the dog food seemed to be tainted with the rat poison - specificlly Aminopterin - and was getting worse by the day.<br /><br />My dog is my life and I would have been devastated to know I had fed her something that would have caused the suffering and anguished death and illness that many of these pets had been forced to endure. So, I started to look around and found it appalling that there was such little oversight in pet food manufacture and control regarding ingredients and labelling. I knew that it was NOT natural for dogs who had been carnivores for thousands of years to be eating all this processed ""scrap"" and bonemeal - no matter how the companies tried to ""re-label"" it. I also though, knew how critical it was for animals to get critical micro-nutrients in appropriately balanced levels and it could be equally devastating for someone uneducated in animal nutrition to think that they could just 'home-cook' meals which could leave gaping holes in these essential minerals, vitamins and micro-nutrients; not to mention the ratios of fats, oils, proteins that the animals need. So, I was searching for a company I could TRUST!<br /><br />I found Merrick and have not turned back! We have never been happier and use both Grammy Pot Pie Kibble as well as some of these canned dog food cans - though since 'we' are a small dog we use the ""smaller"" sized cans (cat food sized 5.5oz) The cans are ironically enough - filled with ingredients that you can read and UNDERSTAND. You can also go to their website and find out what any ingredient that may sound 'foreign' really is and why they used it - I found out they were almost always a natural ingredient that is an alternative to a processed chemical. I also found it comforting that particularly with the canned food I could open it and RECOGNIZE ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise, POTATO! Or a pea, carrot, etc. My dog LOVES this merrick food and has never been healthier! Our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at ""perfect levels"" and she is almost 9. Her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most 'pleasant' aspect to discuss, is that she has almost NO gas (I don't give her much if any people food either) but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on ocassion :) . I think the phrase you get out what you put in applies here as well... I will not switch from Merrick food - ever!

He loves this food! It has chunks of potatoes, carrots, and peas, not to mention chicken and apples. The only downside about ordering it from Amazon is the delivery method. The day the food was delivered, a van pulled up in front of my house and left the 5 cases of food I had ordered outside of my chain link fence next to the mailbox. Needless to say, someone could have taken it if I hadn't seen the delivery woman drop it off. I'm also disabled, and if it hadn't been for my next-door neighbor being outside at the time, I couldn't have gotten the cases of food into my house without her help.

I was lucky enough to find it at a Russian grocery store (YAY!).  But the store is far away and so I had to look around online to buy more, thank God for Amazon.<br /><br />Now, granted, my bottle will likely last years if all I do with it is make Fattoush, one goopy half teaspon at a time, so I've used it in a few other things.  I added a teaspoon to a Lemon Chicken Marinade, a tiny glob to a bowl of greek yogurt (had to add honey too cuz it was sour!),  a tiny amount added to Christmas Salmon cream cheese log, I used it in Fesenjen, a persian stew of chicken and walnuts, I used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a garlicky barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue ever.<br /><br />Just don't do what I did and try to replace the molasses in molasses cookies with pomegranate molasses, what a horrible mess, the cookies looked normal, slightly lighter than normal, but the smell!

They are the second best in terms of absolute flavor.  Bright from proper acid, deep from proper natural salt/sugar balance.  You probably cannot get better tomatoes fresh unless you know a specialty grower, or do it yourself and have no day job.

However, I'm spoiled rotten and only like the flavor that comes with brewing loose tea. So I've been using these empty tea bags in order to make loose tea a lot less messy and just as convenient as bagged tea. Most bags of this type I've encountered are made in Europe and come with a price to match, and a single pack of 100 doesn't last a whole long time.  When I saw this deal here on Amazon, I went for it.<br /><br />The bags look and work identically to the European made ones, although I believe these are made in India. (where they know a whole lot about making tea) But the price is about 2/3 less than that of the European made ones. I can't argue with that. (Well, I could argue with that, but I'm not a dope) That way, we can have the best tea on the market, which is sold loose, without the pain in the neck features of brewing loose tea with a tea ball or strainer. Just throw in the right amount of tea, tuck the top flap into the bag, and that's it. You now have a teabag of your favorite Kenyan Black tea (or whatever makes you happy) Throw away the neat little soggy bag when you're done - no mess at all.<br /><br />I've decided to get these on as a subscription, with a 6 pack arriving twice a year. That way, my family can have three cups or pots of tea each day (This size works for both), and maybe a few more on the weekend before running out. We've been using these bags for several months now, and are still as happy with them as we were when they arrived. If Amazon keeps offering these bags, I am sure we'll keep buying them!

They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors."

At the start of my training I wasn't taking cherry juice.  As I increased my long runs each week my knees and hips were so sore.  I started to take this cherry concentrate and ever since then I have felt pretty good.  I take the juice every morning with my breakfast.  It has a very strong flavor but mixes well with apple or orange juice.  The half marathon I'm running in is this weekend and I feel ready for it thanks in part to the cherry juice helping reduce the pain.  This stuff works for me.

I started drinking this juice three months into what will likely be a four to six month recovery.  Because my doctor has put me on a long-term anti-inflammatory medication, I am not allowed to take over-the-counter medications like Advil and Tylenol.  I can say that taking a glass of this juice has the same pain-killing effect as taking two Advil.  I enjoy two glasses a day - one in the morning and one at dinner.  The only down-side is the sugar, which is really the only processed sugar I eat during the day.  The juice tastes good and the quality of the syrup is consistent and pleasant.<br /><br />I usually don't go for ""miracle"" foods or diet fads, but this juice simply works - this is the real deal.

My back objects to the dancing and my knees object to the running.  I was having a lot of trouble managing my pain and still doing my activities with ibuprofen alone.  I read about tart cherry juice in my running magazine, and I decided to give it a try after reading some of the other reviews here on Amazon.<br /><br />I am simply blown away by the difference!  My body really reacts to this stuff.  My knee pain has disappeared, and my back only hurts during really deep back bends.  I had same-day relief, too.  I can definitely tell the difference on days where I forget to take this!  As an added bonus, I have noted a marked decrease in how sore my muscles are, as well.  I wish I had heard about this sooner!<br /><br />I follow what it says on the bottle, 1 once twice daily.  At first, I was just using a tablespoon and licking it out of the tablespoon (2TBS=1 oz.), which I still do in the mornings, but good lord this stuff is tart!  The first one isn't too bad, I think mostly because your taste buds are in shock.  The second one really gets me, though!  Lately, I've been mixing my ounce into a cup of orange juice at dinner, which looks disgusting but tastes, surprisingly, really good.<br /><br />I really hope this product comes back in stock soon, I don't think I could go without it and I'm hesitant to switch to a different brand.

She specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula. Unfortunately, my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy. I tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better. I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesn't consider it the most tasty of choices- probably because it doesn't have the artificial flavoring in it. But I'd rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste.

We have 2 dogs, 1 that is a picky eater, so we added water and microwave his food for 30 sec.  He loves his dinner & keeps It down. ( full disclosure, he's not the dog with stomach problems.  Our Boston Terrier, who we adopted from a puppy mill situation, eats by gulping down her food, from her years when she had to fight for food.  She is the dog we were targeting by getting sensitive stomach food; she was having a problem with vomiting & regurgitation.  The good news is, if we get her to eat 2-3 small meals a day and try to get her to slow down, problem solved.  Yet, if she eats fastly, without chewing, regurgitation is still a problem.<br /><br />I gave the food 4 stars because. If we do make sure she chews it ( by feeding her a couple morsels at a time, like giving treats) the food stays down, therefore working for vomiting, which was a huge proplem! (she was vomiting 6-9 times a day.) since switching she has stopped vomiting. I don't think our dog is the only one that eats fast, and it does take much longer to feed her.

I tried, I really did. But, it seemed like every other one I tried, which was basically every other one made, including the European t-discs, were not rich enough to satisfy me. I finally gave up and went back to an old fashioned drip coffeemaker so that I could make a nice, rich cup. I was still frustrated by the waste, since I'm the only coffee drinker in my home. Plus, being a basically lazy person, I didn't enjoy filling the reservoir every time I wanted to brew a pot, washing the pot out afterwards, or cleaning out the grounds from the filter.Recently, Tassimo/Gevalia came out with a dark house blend. The front of the package noted: ""New! If you like Starbucks House Blend, try this!"" As a last shot attempt before packing up my Tassimo for storage, I purchased this new t-disc coffee. Tasting my first sip, I was so HAPPY. Really really HAPPY! My coffee is so important to me, and the Gevalia Dark House Blend is AMAZING!!!! It's a rich, full bodied cup of coffee, and as I drink this day after day, I'm starting to think it's even better than my old favorite Starbucks flavors. It's as bold as Starbucks with no bitterness at all. I'd love to hear what others think of this. I am very pleased with it, and I'm so glad that I am able to go back to the simplicity of using my Tassimo brewer, because they make a great t-disc again!"

I was drinking the Starbucks Africa and Verona before ""the breakup.""  I tried the Dark Breakfast from Gevalia, but it's horrible.  I can only drink it after adding the Maestro Lorenzo Espresso Intensivo.  That makes quite a nice cup with a good kick to it.  I even need a little cream in it to smooth it out a bit.<br /><br />But this one is just right.  It's a nice strong cup that doesn't need cream, but can take cream without losing flavor.  This is the first hope I have had for saving my Tassimo machine.  I don't want to go back to the Keurig.<br /><br />p.s.  I would still like a good decaf option.  Right now I use the Gevalia Signature decaf and add a shot of Gevalia decaf espresso to jazz it up."

Gevalia finally came up with coffee worth serving to your guests.<br />Coffee has an earthy bold taste with little to none bitterness and no metallic after taste; it actually leaves a nice smooth tasty chocolaty after taste.<br /><br />The pack comes with 12 big T-discs that will brew 8 ounces of coffee. This coffee will delight those who love the darker roasts.<br /><br />Update:<br />I am on my 5th cup of this coffee and it was really grown on me (changing from a 4 to 5 stars); it is quite tasty and smooth. This is one coffee that will truly satisfy the void that Sbux left. There will be some that will say that this is not the same as Sbux and it isn't! Try the coffee and give it a fair taste without trying to compare it to anything else you may find yourself quite surprised at the findings.  Highly recommended and definitely will be buying this one again.

I drink everything from DD to starbucks to nespresso to good blends from fairway .. this one is pretty much right on with the description - dark brew good medium body - it has a strong flavor but is smooth and no aftertaste at all, reminiscent of how sbux does brew their beans (but I like this better than the sbux house coffee..it's not quite as edgy), and is unlike many of the other gevalia coffees for Tassimo that I just don't like b/c of their aftertaste (bitter, to me) .. this one brews at 190 degrees (at least mine did), which is a bit hotter than I would make a cup of latte for example (at 160) so be careful on that first sip!  but I do think this one's a keeper...

This one finally blew everything else away. It's delicious. The dark house blend is now my preferred t-disc when I want coffee. Since I'm not a coffee snob I don't like to get crazy with the adjectives, but this one has a very deep and pleasing coffee flavor. Full-bodied is a good way to describe it, as opposed to a lesser-bodied coffee that may smell good but tastes watered down when you drink it. This is definitely the best coffee I've ever tasted out of a home brewing machine and even better than many cafes can muster. It has no aftertaste and it is not bitter. You can drink it black with no sweetener and enjoy it, or add some cream. Even if you go heavy on the creamer it doesn't lose is flavor. Buy it, and ignore the starbucks haters. Seriously, starbucks' coffees are not as good as everyone makes them out to be. Dunkin Donuts coffee has them beat in price and quality.

So, I guess this is the going price for homemade biscotti these days?<br /><br />The flavor is very almondy. And, the hardness is just perfect.  The biscotti is hard and crunchy, but it's not so hard that you couldn't eat it without dunking (as some biscotti are).  This biscotti can be eaten ""as is"" or can be dunked in coffee, tea or cocoa.  I dunked mine in Chai Tea and it tastes great.  And, the biscotti does not fall apart when dunked.<br /><br />I like the almond flavor, but I wish this came in anise flavor.  That's my favorite biscotti flavor."

They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.<br /><br />I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.<br /><br />Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.<br /><br />I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try."

After reading some favorable comparisons between those and Mahogany, I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />I find that it's slightly less bitter (not that bitter is bad) than Newman's EB or Dark Magic, and a little smoother.  I also think it's more full bodied without any burned bean flavor.  I've tried the Mahogany on the larger cup setting and actually still liked it -- something I've never said before.

I was relieved to see the O.N.E. coconut water with a ""splash of pineapple"" so I figured I'd give it a go.<br />The woman at the counter said ""are you sure you want that? It's $4."" Steep! But it's an airport, what can you do? By that point I was so wanting to try it I said sure.  After all, it would've been $3 for a sticky sweet soda.<br />I was so happy with it that I kept the empty tetra pack with me the whole time I traveled so I would know which one it was.  It doesn't taste heavy (in case the pina colada reference made it sound that way) but the pineapple takes the edge off the green coconut water.

My brother hates coconut water,but loves this stuff. This drink is not too sweet,and has the perfect balance of pureed pineapple and natural coconut water subtly mixed together.

Coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things.  Coconut water comes from a green, immature coconut, while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut...a hard, brown, fiber covered shell.  Just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different, the same can be said of coconut.  If you don't think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada, you will probably enjoy it even more."

I never really loved the taste of it, but I spend a great deal of time in the desert and I just can't seem to suck down enough water without getting waterlogged, so I was excited when I found flavors.  I know that recently it's become trendy and much harder for me to find, but my friends have been drinking it for years, as has my yoga instructor, and they highly recommend it for drinking not only for sports, but also to keep hydrated.  Plus, it's done wonders for my always dry skin.<br /><br />If nothing else it's a great avoid a hangover cure if drunk before going to bed, and if your partied too much to avoid being sick it seems to work much better than Pedialyte to get your electrolytes back in balance.

The ONE coconut water is refreshing, delicious, and just barely sweet. Really wonderful stuff. The hint of pineapple adds a little bit of acidity that enhances the basic taste of the water. i bet this would make a great summer drink too, but I only had one so I didn't get tot try that.

It is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions.  I happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix.  The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition, even a splash puts it up front and center.  This added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some.  It would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or, in my case, after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the Northeast.

According to the packaging, ""it has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.""  There's a smidge of fiber, 0.8 g of protein and 16 g of sugars.  I suspect most of the sugar comes from the pineapple, but ""cane juice"" is one of the ingredients, too. The 8.5 fl oz carton comes to 75 calories.<br /><br />If you sign up for subscribe & save, it's less than $1 per carton.  Actually, the carton is the only thing I don't like about this drink.  It's sort of hard to drink directly from because there isn't any air getting let in when you drink, which makes a vacuum.  This was solved by pouring it into a glass.  *whew*<br /><br />This was good.  I will definitely get more, and I highly recommend this to people who like pineapple juice."

There is an underlying hint of coconut, I know the water isn't strongly flavored, but I wasn't expecting so much pineapple.  This is tangy and sweet.  It is alright.  Package is smaller, but I don't think I could handle too much more of it in one sitting.  I am not thrilled with their unflavored coconut water, it is too tangy/sour to me, so with the pineapple it helps cover up that funkiness for me.  Not sure I'd buy this again.  Still in search of the one I first tried and fell in love with, but so far not finding anything as light and fresh tasting.

Since I'm not a competitive athlete and don't have any great need to replenish my electrolytes, I'd rather just drink water.

COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is the drink for you.  I found this drink to be almost overpoweringly sweet as a standalone beverage.  According to the package, O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE contains natural coconut water, natural pineapple juice, cane juice, vitamin C, and natural fruit flavor.  Personally, with the coconut and the pineapple, I think they could have left out the sugar cane.<br /><br />However, when I paired O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE with a light snack of cheese and crackers, it became a very tasty, refreshing drink.  I, apparently, needed a little salt and/or savory to make O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE completely palatable.  With the afore mentioned snack, the O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is really delightful.  I can also see it being very invigorating on a hot summer today (not so much with the cold winter weather).<br /><br />O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE comes in a handy 8.5 oz box with a place to punch a straw through.  This type of packaging is nice if you are on the go or have kids.  Just throw it in your bag and go.<br /><br />Prior to this experience, I had not heard of coconut water.  On the packaging it says ""O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is a blend of the natural water from inside a young, green coconut and sweet, golden pineapple juice. It has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.""  Huh...who knew you could drink a green coconut?  Educational and a good source of potassium.  Being allergic to bananas, it is always good to have another source.<br /><br />Overall, I would not drink O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE by itself in the middle of winter.  But together with non-sugary snack or in the high heat of summer, I would definitely give O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE another try."

I didn't pay close attention when ordering, and expected the larger, 11.5 oz size. Not a big deal, and was my fault, but it's a little too small to be useful.<br /><br />Taste: Ick. I love coconut water. I love pineapple juice. I love lightly flavored coconut water. This tastes like none of the above. The flavor is sickly sweet (ingredients included added sugar), and with none of the nice mellow coconut flavor of other coconut waters I've tried. Might as well be a processed kids drink.<br /><br />Alternatives: While I actually prefer O.N.E.'s regular, unflavored coconut water over other brands, the Vita Coco coconut water with a splash of pineapple is far superior to this one. It comes in a larger package, doesn't have added sugar, has more vitamins and nutrients (this one is diluted with sugar water), and tastes like you're drinking it fresh on the beach. This one is just...not great.

First off all it taste pretty good but its kinda sugary and salty. Its an ok drink but when you think about it and you compare it to others this drink is not as healthy as others. Its more like a juice drink than a healthy one. Compared to Vitacoco it has more calories, twice the sodium, half the potassium and almost half the vitamin C. This drink also has less magnesium, phosphorous, and 4 times less calcium. The only this the drink does have over Vitacoco is the 1 less gram of sugar.

The taste doesn't resemble anything close to a 'Pina Colada' flavor and it was actually difficult to taste the pineapple or coconut in it.  It just tastes tangy and a little sour... like water that has a bit of sugar and sour-ness to it. Yeah, not really a taste I crave. I'm not sure if everyone had this reaction to this drink, but it just didn't appeal to me. I really wanted to like it though, because as I said before... I usually love pineapple coconut drinks.

Sort of like all-natural Gatorade with anti-oxidents.<br /><br />Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.<br /><br />It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.<br /><br />If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars.

First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.<br /><br />The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.<br /><br />There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.

I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing.

When I brought him home from the breeder, I kept him on the 'Pro Plan Puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.  There was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as I put it down.  As a test, I rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen...he'd eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with. (Which I was happy with, as I don't want to 'play' with his food as a game to get him to eat).  I went and got him Blue Buffalo dry puppy food (lamb and oatmeal formula), which had bigger size kibbles.  It seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits, since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones, venison antler, lamb lung chips for comfort.  Again when I got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag, he would walk away from the bowl---this went on for almost 3 days.  He was still having small bowel movements, urinating, drinking water and playing, running and continuing his successful training exercises; called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by Science Diet/Veterinarian's Diet after the exam, which showed nothing physically wrong.  The one vet tech said that Shih Tzu's tend to be picky eaters.  I didn't pick up the food at their check out counter, left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet.  I know from some of our outdoor excursions that he's attracted to road kill (he'll sniff the air, and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices...but I won't allow it).  I remember being a kid in the late 60's early 70's and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then: Gravy Train or Alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat; they ate bones, etc and all lived into their late teens.  One of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old!!!  I never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem, since I grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance.  Well, I read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the Sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs/breasts.  My Weston isn't a big fan of totally raw meat, but when browned (I put it in the toaster oven and add 1/4 tsp of 'Missing Link' to the meat portion) with the soaked Sojos Original, he eats with gusto!!!  From his early days, I would play with and take his food away, so he's not food aggressive.  He eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done.  Weston then wants to play hard, train hard, take a nice walk and nap.  His coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed.  The droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up.  I just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this Sojos mix with the same gusto (even with the e-collar to challenge him).  So I am a fan and we are finished with the second 2.5 lb bag and I just ordered another one.  Hope this helps someone with a picky eater; I know another reviewer mentioned their Shih Tzu not liking it, but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other, much like us humans.

I have a younger Springer who also loves the bones but she doesn't need much motivation to do anything, ha, but they are also great training aids.  I also sent home a handful of these bones with a painter I had at my home for his 3 dogs and he said they loved them too....so I guess that's antidotal but that's 5 dogs that really love the things!  Oh, the bones are way more expensive when you find them at your Vet, about twice as much per pound, so this is a great buy.  Buy a nice food safe container from Home Depot and fill it up.  You won't run out of bones for a while and that's a good thing!

It's truly a diet tea--there are zero calories. It's best served chilled; and it has a mild but not overwhelming peach flavor to it that is just right. Snapple makes this with green and black tea leaves; there's also a mild green tea flavor mixed in with the peach flavoring. They use filtered water as well. This tea is sweetened somewhat with Aspartame; but Snapple adds in just the right amount so that it's not excessively sweet. If you want really tea that is rather sweet, you'll either have to look further or use this with added sweetener. It also contains phenylalanine and it is kosher if these are dietary concerns for you.<br /><br />If you have other questions, the company has a toll free number so that people can contact them.<br /><br />Overall, this tea is perfect for a hot summer's day when you want something cool to refresh yourself and whet your whistle.

Neither chemical nor natural treatment has gotten rid of them completely.

I had even used it on potted plants which were also infested & it worked on everything.<br />Remember, the product is systemic and is absorbed gradually into the plant so you will not see an immediate improvement but it works wonderfully.  Also if like me, you don't always remember to spray regularly or get the underneaths of the leaves, then something which you can sprinkle at the base of the plant every 6-8 weeks is certainly a lot easier to use.

This was my first try of this mustard.  It was unique, similar to many other hot mustards, but I favored it over the others I have because of the balance of flavors.  It's almost as hot as English (Coleman's) mustard, but a little sweeter and maybe a slight vinegar essence in it. The tube and a bag of pretzels lasted me one or two evenings.

I am finally finishing my case of cans, because it is good food. However, I do not plan on getting any more of this particular product because every can has a little something extra: bits and pieces of chitinous shell, mostly from the shrimp but also a few hard pieces now and then from the lobster. They are small pieces, which means taking small spoonfuls and not biting down hard on anything, and don't eat the last spoonful. I find six to eight pieces of this debris in each can. Like I said before, I am finishing the case, because it is food and pretty good at that. But I just don't appreciate having to be that careful with my soup.

She's of the opinion that Baxter's is absolutely the BEST canned soup on the Planet (of the soups she's tasted, which include the major American brands - she doesn't cook much). The Lobster Bisque rated just below Baxter's Scottish Smoked Salmon (which she rated the BEST EVER). (From my own perspective, and usually cooking my own food, I have to admit that the Baxter's soup line, for canned soup, is superior).

This stuff, while not completely horrible, needs some love before it's decent. The texture isn't quite there, not thin enough to be soup but not up to bisque level either. As for the taste, it's rather bad. A little on the bland side. As a Marylander I reached for the one thing that fixes all things seafood, Old Bay. Dumped in a liberal amount and stirred while still on the heat. The Old Bay added a nice taste that made it tolerable to eat. Doubt I'll be purchasing this brand again though.

They taste the same as the dark seeds.

I was excited to see such a great price on these from a reputable company. These are the best tasting flaxseeds I have ever had. To get the maximum health benefits you have to finely grind them in a standard coffee grinder. We usually grind 2 tablespoons per person twice a day and then add them to lemonade, crystal light, or tea and drink it down quick before it expands. Flaxseeds are loaded with minerals, vitamins, amino acids, and fiber. They are excellent for weight loss and work well for chronic constipation. There are several web sites out there that can tout the health benefits of flaxseeds but unfortunately it's against the review guidelines to post links so I'll just suggest to those of you wanting more information to search google.

This is the best tasting flax I have ever had.  BUT, I have to throw it in the coffee grinder, and then pick out little rocks that are barely bigger than the seeds.  I found this out the hard way after using the seeds whole.  Nothing like working a bite trying to find where the rock you just bit is.<br /><br />After you grind, sift the powder and black stones will be evident.  I have about 1-2 per quarter cup of ground mixture.  Perhaps this is something you organic foodies are used to, I am not.<br /><br />I have only used 1 bag so far, so I cannot comment on whether or not the stones are in the others, but I highly doubt it was a fluke bag.

Best used in oatmeal as the flavors blend well.  Or in a cold cereal, or added to a cup of coffee for a twist. Seem to blend better in hot foods.

Also keep in mind that Chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products. All the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the United States.  Why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price?  Your purchasing choice does make a difference.  Let's stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy.  They never will.  We can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well-being. Make purchase decisions wisely.

So if that was the main deterent back then, it's no longer an issue. I just discovered this snack and as a person who can't eat either gluten, soy, or dairy, I am thrilled to find a snack I can eat first of all, and a snack I can eat that is actually tasty, even better! I've been eating these for a few days now and no adverse reactions (and I have an extremely sensitive stomach). I plan on trying out all the flavors to figure out which ones I like the best but yeah, I'd highly recommend this product to those on restricted diets and even to those who aren't.

Very near the top of the list of the best nut snacks is Mrs. May's Almond Crunch. From the first time I tasted it, to every time I eat it now, I am amazed at the crunchiness, quality of the almonds, lightly-sweetened glaze which is very unbrittle-like, attention to healthiness in the ingredients, etc. As a side note, because of how much I was impressed by this product, I went on a tasting spree by buying about 12 different kinds of Mrs. May's products, from the peanut and cashew crunches to the various sesame crunches, etc. Perhaps I'm biased to the original, but none of the others have that same magic. I would rate the rest as 4 stars. But the almond crunch should get 6 stars.

To briefly address these: There has been no evidence that Mrs. Mays keeps its workers in sweatshops; despite the Communism, I'm sure the individual citizens find these jobs valuable; and ships produce 1/10th the carbon per pound-mile of trucks, meaning a 5000 miles by ship is as bad as 500 miles by truck.<br /><br />I really like the snack and I'd give it five stars, but I'm subtracting one star: I think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in China. I don't have a problem with the snack's origin, but Mrs. Mays should be more forthright with their customers and let them make the decision themselves. Granted, most of us Americans are primed to flip out at the latest Scare of the Week, but that should be our choice to make.<br /><br />Oh, and the snack itself? It is quite tasty, filling, and healthy. I will continue to purchase it."

It's usually all the same to me.  HOWEVER... when I tried this brand of pasta, I noticed that it does taste better.  I can't describe how exactly, but it does.  I thought maybe it was my imagination (maybe knowing it's organic was influencing my judgment) but my sister commented on it when I served it for her one day.  She wanted to know where I got it - it tasted so good.  Hmmm.  So while usually there isn't much of a taste difference when it comes to noodles and pasta, for this brand there is.  It's subtle, but it's there.  When we moved from California I discovered they didn't sell it in the stores here in NY.  So I was elated when I found Amazon carries it.  Elated over a simple pasta?  Yes, that's how good it is in comparison!  Mmmmmm Mmmmm!

It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly.

If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something ""healthlier."" I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is."

I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!

The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

Seriously, the Stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!<br /><br />If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product.

I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again.

This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.

I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said ""natural"", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong ""mint"" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water.

The only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long, the calories WILL add up - I think each packet is 60 calories.  I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.

I believe this additive is the culprit to ruining what should have been a delightful bouquet to my nose.  Then I brewed this tea, and could still taste that additive, but overall the tea was tasty.  I hope the Davidson family reads our reviews because I am certain that, if they would just refrain from adding the ""natural flavor,"" I and others would find this tea to be superb, and in keeping with the other teas I have come to enjoy from Davidson's.  For example, upon opening their Darjeeling loose tea, as well as their Assam loose tea, my nose is struck with a lovely bouquet ~ this is what one wants to experience from superb teas.

I try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners so this was perfect because it contains absolutely no sweetener so I can add my own (mostly liquid stevia).  I also love vanilla flavoring in many things I make so I sometimes use this in place of extract which can be pricey if you use it a lot. For example, I make my own almond milk so I like to add vanilla to sweeten and lighten the taste. This works better than an extract because there is no alcohol taste. I also make blueberry syrup with agave and this flavoring and it turns out very good. I put it in pancake batter and the flavor still holds after cooking (also with cookies). I use this all the time and now I am not dropping $10 every couple of weeks for vanilla extract.

That is exactly what I was looking for in a popcorn because my 3 year old LOVES popcorn.  With 3 year old children, you have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or hurting their tender gums.  My son has no trouble eating this popcorn.  It is soft and light, doesn't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much, and has a great flavor.<br /><br />This is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family.  I usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems.  I get very few unpopped kernels. Another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping, but I have not experienced this problem (it could depend on the popper, I suppose).  I have tried microwaving it in a paper bag, but I always seem to end up burning it.  I think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right, so I just stick with my hot air popper. I get great popcorn every time!

It is the best popcorn I've had. I thought I would mind the smaller kernel size, but I didn't. There is substantially less hull than regular popcorn. The flavor is great. I suggest using peanut oil for popping popcorn. It gives popcorn a great nutty taste - really delicious. You can buy peanut oil at any oriental (Asian) store. It's better than olive oil (olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me). But peanut oil is perfect. You won't need butter flavor or anything like that again (artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals). Now, we pop around three times a day and always crave this for a snack instead of junkfood. Try it and you'll be popping like us.

I used the Whirley Pop popcorn maker and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and popped it according to the instructions of the whirley popper. While the majority of the kernels popped, there was also a large amount of 'seeds' or residue that can get caught in your teeth and are somewhat distracting while you're eating. I actually got better results using Orville Redenbacher White Popcorn Kernels in the Whirley Popper (and it was actually cheaper at the local market). Overall I give Amish Country 3 out of 5 stars and mostly for the presentation of the package than for the yield results.

I am not usually a fan of soup out of the can.<br />2. I am really picky about my clam chowder.<br /><br />That said, I get this stuff in bulk.  There are several reasons for this, the first of which is the great flavor of clams and potatoes.  Second, I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and, third, that one can adjust the level of creaminess and viscosity with what one adds to the soup (I like to use a mixture of milk and cream).  The fourth plus is that this soup contains neither bacon nor excessive amounts of spice or pepper - two things that ruin clam chowder for me.  I know bacon is popular with a lot of folks but I really just want to taste the clams when I have a bowl of New England clam chowder.  If you're like me in that respect, then I think you will like this soup too!<br /><br />p.s. As a child, I was a fan of Friendly's clam chowder (before they changed their recipe).  Bar Harbor is even better!

Picked this up at the supermarket, drawn by the all natural ingredients (for once no MSG or really anything else I didn't recognize). It's really quite good, and especially so for coming out of a can. I can have excellent clam chowder -- and with a little milk and butter, exactly to my liking -- warm within minutes. One of the few canned goods I keep in my cabinet, and one of the most convenient and surprisingly satisfying meals always 5 minutes away.<br />Highly recommended.

It tasted incredibly bland, and didn't have much clam flavor.  So then I added more milk, butter, onions, salt and fresh ground pepper, plus white wine.  For 2.92 per 15 oz. can, all of those ingredients should have been adequately added in there already, except for the pepper. Bar Harbor brand certainly didn't stint on the other ingredients in order to increase the amount of clams, that's for sure.  There were larger pieces of clams than in Progresso's - but that's damning with faint praise.  Next time I'll buy the clams and make my own, for less, probably.  I'm just perplexed by these reviews;  I think I can safely say Progresso's tastes better.  And, of course, it's much less expensive.

The consistency was pretty good too.  It just had no flavor.  Not going to be buying this again, certainly not when it's this expensive, too.

Bookbinders is one that comes to mind.  I don't buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients, so my choice is limited.  For this one, if I add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter, along with some extra sea salt, it's ok.  The longer it is gently heated -- not simmered or boiled -- to let the flavors mingle, the better it becomes.  More clams and potatoes would improve it.  As it is, the ingredients were skimpy.

Most importantly, this chowder tastes MOUTH-WATERING GOOD and is bursting with flavor. I use whole milk and add a pinch of pepper, and this aromatic chowder is devoured in minutes. If you have not already, definitely give it a try.

The clams were tender, fresh, plentiful, and remarkably non-gritty. The 'taters' were tasty and not overly done. I would recommend that they cut-back a bit on the tapioca starch and add some medium cream, instead.  I like to add some diced Vidalya onion or red bell pepper. Stir in some milk, butter, and black pepper, and you're on your way to a delightful meal.

Even when I added salt, pepper, milk, and butter, it didn't taste like the best I've had. But at least it's edible, unlike every other canned clam chowder out there. If I can find a way to make this taste better than I'd love it. It's the best CANNED clam chowder I've ever had, but it's not that great. The clams taste good.<br /><br />EDIT: I had a 2nd can and I made it today, I added only a little bit of milk and I added NO salt, pepper, or butter, and it actually tastes a lot better than when I did. So I suggest adding nothing but some milk or cream to this soup. It's still not the best I've ever had though.

What good is a classic New England clam chowder without these classic ingredients?<br /><br />Instead, the first ingredient listed is: Clams. Next you'll be telling me it's got butter in it (it does? Oh.).<br /><br />On a more serious note. Bar Harbor makes a good tasting clam chowder. The first list of ingredients came from Snow's and Campbell's condensed New England clam chowders. This Bar Harbor stuff is worth it.

It's not loaded up with canola oil like Campbell's and Progresso, so you can add a little quality EVOO like California Olive Ranch, or even butter for a healthier brew if you prefer it that way like we do. I also add a little half and half, and saute some Hormel Bacon bits with red onion and garlic to add complexity to the flavor. I was impressed. I usually also add some Gorton's Wild Pacific Salmon (frozen, in most markets) to basically make it a healthy fish chowder.

After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters."

Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the ""healthier"" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.<br /><br />This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I'll add this to my grocery list whenever it's on sale or the price is right."

I love the idea of an all-natural hydrating drink that is low in sugar and high in potassium.  Whenever I am hot, thirsty or a little run-down, I find that Vita Coco Coconut Water with Pineapple really quenches my thirst, refreshes me, and gives me a little energy boost without added sugar or any artificial ingredients like the ones in Gatorade and other drinks aimed at balancing electrolytes.  An 8-1/2-ounce serving  has only 60 calories and 30 mg of Sodium (less than fat-free milk), with 515 mg of Potassium and 180% of the RDA of Vitamin C.  It's a little pricey, but if you can buy it on sale with free shipping, it's a great value.  Although I have previously purchased it on Amazon, I more recently bought it at GNC during Gold Card Week when there was a free shipping offer and a ""buy 2, get 1 free"" offer.

I am a rural mail carrier and have to be out in the hot weather. In the afternoon I get hot, dry, and thirsty. I am trying to lose weight so I'm watching my calories. Water is wet and cold but doesn't quench my thirst. This stuff does the trick. It quenches my thirst and gives me a little pick-up for the afternoon and keeps me going. This only has 60 calories per serving, so that is much less than a 180 calorie Gatorade. I recommend this to those looking for a healthy alternative to the sugary sports drinks.

All coca tea  Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods.  An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br />Do not store coca tea  products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea.

The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.

They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!

Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.<br /><br />Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.<br /><br />You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.<br /><br />Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.<br /><br />Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.<br /><br />Enjoy!

The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the ""modern"" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for ""hill""), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the ""cream"" in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: ""Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees"").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit."

Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, ""100 calorie packs"" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + ""ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS"" & ""ARTIFICIAL COLORS"" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history."

I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of ""A Star Is Born"" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are ""100 Calorie Packs"", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack."

In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags.

Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0"">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>"

But sensibly I drink decaffienated coffee during afternoon and evening hours. And a flavored coffee is a real treat. But some can be overpowering. This ""Jamaican Me Crazy"" flavor not only suits my personality(HA), it is very pleasing to the palate. The flavoring is very subtle while allowing the full flavor of the coffee to be enjoyed. And oh, the aroma is delicious! Both while grinding the beans and brewing the coffee. I will definitely purchase this again."

You know, like the one sitting at the bar at a restaurant. I wanted to offer some broken pieces along with olives, pepperoni, and some prosciutto.  All for a New Years eve party. Well it was not a wheel - thank goodness because it was half a wheel and at 20 pounds for the half wheel, 40 pounds would have been way too much. The flavor was excellent, just enough of bite.  The creaminess of the cheese really came through and was a perfect balance. I broke up the half wheel into thirds and decorated a tray with a cascading effect of broken pieces. It was all well received with the choices of red wine. There was more than enough, which has allowed me to enjoy the flavors for other favorite dishes for a couple of more weeks. I am looking forward to ordering this again - Super Bowl is right around the corner. It is big, so make sure you can carry and store this quantity. As far as cost, I thought it was a great deal since it seemed to have much less rind than what we purchase elsewhere. The cost per pound may be average, but the amount of actual usable cheese is there with the great flavor.

You will not regret it.<br /><br />They are, hands down, the best store-bought chocolate cookies out there, and I buy every new brand that comes out (from Mrs Fields to all the permuatations offerred by Pepperidge Farms).<br /><br />These are much better than Entenmann's recent incarnation of ""new recipe"" chocolate chip cookies, the milk chocolate chip and ""soft baked"" chocolate chip cookies. Both of these newer cookie species are awful: the milk chocolate tastes like rotting bananas and the cookie part tastes like all the other crappy store-bought soft cookies out there.<br /><br />In contrast, Entenmann's Original Recipe chocolate cookie is a mind-blowing experience: delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouth-watering cookie with a unique but ineffable taste. They seem to have perfected the ratio of flour to sugar, so that the cookie is delicious without weighing you down with excessive sugary sweetness (this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookies).<br /><br />I have absolutely no idea why Entenmann's decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the classical recipe and replace it with these disgusting brands. It seems to have happened when the Entenmann name was bought by a larger multinational company, so it was probably a money-saving opportunity. The Original Recipe cookies likely have expensive ingredients.<br /><br />The only problem is they are so hard to find: thank goodness they are now on Amazon!!!"

Plain cake though was disappointing.  So get creative instead.

The vanilla flavor was so subtle that I missed it entirely, and I felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness (which probably would have also made them a bit more moist). The child I made them for only ate a few bites.

I couldn't really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor.  The cake is yellow, dense (but not like a pound cake) and texture-y like brown rice has more texture than white rice.  I thought the sweetness was just right.  I think I would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it.

It contains hibiscus, roasted barley malt, roasted chicory root, rosehips, chamomile flowers, natural plum flavor with other natural flavors, ginger root, roasted carob, and cardamom. It does not contain caffeine, so it's technically an herbal tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use ""natural flavors"" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called ""effervescent decaffeination"" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.<br /><br />On the package, Celestial Seasonings writes, ""Take a sip of Sugar Plum Spice and journey with us to the Land of the Sweets in Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. Here you'll find gingerbread houses, trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with sunshine. This is the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy, who is beautiful, gentle and kind. We created this tea to pay tribute to her. Sugar Plum Spice is made with 100% natural herbs and the festive flavors of plum and spice, with just a hint of sweetness."" This tea is slightly sweet and full bodied, tasting just as you would expect from the description. The cardamom and ginger give it a little zing. Each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and I only need to use one at a time.<br /><br />I recommend it, even if it's not a holiday. It's perfect for a cold or wet winter day.<br /><br />****"

I was happy to see that I can order online.  However, I purchase the 20 pack and they overstuffed the box.  There is no bubble wrap or any type of wrapping around the individual packages before they put it into the box.  They choose a small box that can barely fix all twenty packages.  It is overstuffed to the point that the box is no longer squared, but rounded somewhat.  The postal service does not treat the package with care, so when it arrived, there was a wet stain.  When we opened it, two packages had been damaged, and the butter leaked all over all the other packages.  We had to spend a long time washing all the packages, because they are all greasy.  The greasiness does not wash off easily even with soap.  Now when eating them, some of the other packages of popcorn got water in them because of the washing, they are not air-tight packages.  So when popping them, there are a lot of unpopped kernels.  They should use bigger boxes and wrap it better.

If you're trying to eat 5-7 meals a day to lose weight, make one of these cups one of your meals, the protein fills you up and makes you feel good.

They are a fantastic option for containing horses while camping, etc.  They are easy to use, give your horse some walking around room,  don't require a level set-up area, are flexible for size/shape, and are  small enough to keep handy in your trailer's tack room.  I much prefer using these to portable panels, high-lining, tying to the trailer, etc.<br /><br />There are many portable corral kits on the market, all very similar with the same kinds of components.  (Except the Zareba EZEE, which is a different animal.)  So I'll give you a component-by-component rundown on the items in this kit.<br /><br />CHARGER - This kit comes with a charger that takes 2 D batteries.  I was leery of this, having had less-than-stellar performance from a 2D charger in the past.  But this one works pretty good, producing a reasonable strength zap with 100 feet of electric tape (with good grounding in damp, solid soil).  If your horse is already accustomed to and respectful of electric fencing, this should be sufficient.  The charger is easy to use, with the fence and ground terminals clearly marked.  The on-off switch is very accessible, and a light and an audible sound tell you when it's on.<br /><br />ELECTRIC TAPE --  This kit is advertised as coming with 200 feet of ½"" tape.  My kit had only 100 feet.  100 feet is enough for one horse.  I don't know where they're coming with up the statement `perfect for containing 4-5 horses for short periods of time'.  No way, not even close, even if I had received the full 200 feet.  Of course, it's easy enough to pick up more electric tape at the farm store.  But beware that the more tape you add on, the less zap you'll get from your charger.  So I'm not sure if the 2D charger would be strong enough with 200 feet of tape.  The tape in this kit comes with a handle pre-installed.  It's a nice handle with a good feel to it, but it doesn't connect nicely to the posts.  I rigged up an extra little tape loop to hook the  handle to.<br /><br />STEP-IN POSTS - These are my favorite kind of step-in posts.  Each post has numerous clips to slide the tape through, so you can set at the right height.  It's very quick and easy to insert and remove the tape from the clips, making set-up and take-down easier.<br /><br />CORNER GUY LINES - This kit comes with some very nice corner guy lines and metal bracing stakes.  Honestly, I'll probably never use them.  With this style of fence, there usually isn't much (if any) tension on the posts, so  I've needed corner guy lines.  Why add to set-up and take-down time?  But if you prefer to use the corner guy lines, I think you'll like the ones in this kit.  They are nice quality adjustable lines, with metal stakes.<br /><br />WIRES, GROUND ROD, ETC -- Of course this kit contains the necessary wires to connect the charger to the fence, and the charger to ground.  The ground rod is a 12"" pointed spike.  Nothing special here.<br /><br />CARRYING BAG - Oh my gosh, A+++ for this carrying bag!  The bag has one long skinny section for the posts, and a separate snap-off zipper tote for the other components.  Within the smaller bag, there  are separate compartments and elastic holders for each piece.  No more jumble of stuff!!!  I love it.  (One quibble - one of the step-in posts had pierced the bag during packing or shipping.  The bag is made of pretty heavy-duty fabric, but not quite heavy-duty enough to stand up to a pointed spike.  And the ends of the bag are not reinforced to avoid this problem.)<br /><br />All in all, this portable fence kit is about as good as any I've seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral.  Just don't expect it to ""contain 4-5 horses "", unless you're rotating those horses in and out one at a time."

If I wanted to buy a new energizer and more polytape then it would be great to own, as my review below states:<br /><br />Easy one-page instructions and everything fits nicely back inside the bag, without struggling...<br /><br />I needed this portable paddock for my goats because I have a lot of unfenced acreage beyond the barn area.  I was worried about the fence being suitable for goats so I called Customer Service...The rep went to a lot of trouble and checked this for me and said it would work fine for goats as well.  However, several days later, I called back and spoke to another rep and he said that goats needed much higher voltage.  This particular energizer is 3,000 volts and that goats needed 5,000 to 8,000 volts. But he said I could just buy another pulse type energizer and it would work with the tape that I have.  I have older, very mellow goats so the 3,000 volts are working so far.<br /><br />I have different breeds and therefore different heights of goats and one concern was that the clips on the post wouldn't be low enough to the ground for my mixed breed goats but on the post, it has clips all the way down so that the tape can be hung at various heights.  However, even though the post is listed as 4ft high, I measured and they are actually 47 1/8  inches tall and after you push the metal tip into the ground, you are left with a height of 38 inches.  The tape rests at the bottom of the top clip which holds the tape at 35 inches off the ground.  Seems awfully short for horses but I don't know anything about horses either.<br /><br />The instructions are clear and has helpful diagrams, making it all very easy to put together.  I did have problems at the end tying it to the last post.  I had to call Customer Service, and the rep said that you CANNOT unroll the whole spool of polytape if you are hanging it to the last post via the spool, which is per the instructions.  Since I had already unrolled it to the end, I had to tie the end of the polytape to the post or to the empty spool container, which he said was okay, but then it's not easy to untie that knot.<br /><br />In lieu of posts, you can hang the guy wire around trees and then slide the electric tape through the loop.  Guy wires, which are similar to tent stakes give the posts extra stability, but I saw no need for them at all since the clay soil held the posts very well.<br /><br />My ground is hard clay but the fence posts sunk in easily, despite that.  It had rained within the last week though so it may be different depending on the dryness of the soil.  The posts are sturdy, and strong enough to not break with normal use.  I did have gravel in some spots which made me have to relocate a few posts, since the tips would not go past them.<br /><br />There is no mention of the tape being allowed to touch weeds and grass, so I called Customer Service back to find that out. He said that that only a low impedance energizer can be used near grass and this energizer is NOT low impedance.  So, I had to mow where I wanted to put the fence to avoid any problems with grounding.  Not very practical when out on the road.<br /><br />Planning the fence was harder than I imagined because I couldn't make a perfect square and I thought I had measured correctly but still fell short of where I wanted the fence to end.  I then discovered that I was only given 126 feet of polytape rather than the 200 feet.  Doing a trial run of setting the fence up is recommended.<br /><br />I wanted something that was easy.  I'm a small middle-aged female and needed something that wasn't too much trouble so I could move it around without a lot of sweat and tears.  This is perfect for my goat situation if they had just sent me the correct length tape.  It seems too short for horses but I posted the measurements in case it helped someone who has horses.

I am using it for supplemental grazing of horses, particularly to get small areas that are not permanently enclosed as pasture, but that get overgrown and/or delicious.<br /><br />I like it. Setup time, once you figure out the components, is about 15 minutes. It has all the pieces to make a very reasonable temporary electric corral - tape, posts, charger, ground, and gate hook.<br /><br />The 8 step-in posts are fairly standard: they have nice pointy metal stakes at the bottom that make them relatively easy to insert in moist ground. You probably can't get them into rock hard dry ground, but that's not a surprise. There are clips to give you flexibility in the fence height. But - you've probably seen them at the feed store - this kind of post is pretty short and will feel quite short compared to a normal horse fence.<br /><br />The kit is supposed to come with 200' of 1/2"" electric tape. Mine (as a Vine kit) only had 100'. This is enough for one very well behaved horse in a 25x25 square. The tape is not much of a visual barrier, especially with only one strand. This is not a fence I'd trust for a problem horse or for long unattended periods. 200' would be enough for either two strands or to have a 50x50 square and would be a much better value of time spent to grazing time. 50 x 50 is still quite small and the fence is still not substantial. It would be straightforward to add tape, but adding distance also increases the load on the charger.<br /><br />The product description says 4-5 horses. I would not feel safe doing that. Two quiet horses who know each other well and are already familiar with electric fence, maybe three for very brief periods, if you had the 50 x 50 and were nearby or had a secure outer fence. For grazing, three horses would have the area mowed in just a couple of hours.<br /><br />The charger - which uses 2 D batteries - has plenty of zap new. I was pleased by how easy it was to work with. It has its own spike, allowing you to set it up away from the fence.  The connections are long enough that you can put it out of nose range. The grounding nail was easy to set up and pull out.<br /><br />I like that it comes with a simple corner bracing system. You can set it up without the corner braces, depending upon how tight you like your fence and how stiff the ground is. But when you need the braces, you're glad to have the option.<br /><br />The tape comes on a handy small spinning jenny, which is designed to hang on the fence when it is installed. It's a simple thing, and thoughtfully done. It makes it easy to unroll the fence when setting up, and easy to reroll when putting it away. There is no problem doing the whole setup and takedown by yourself.<br /><br />The hook for the gate isn't quite a match for the brackets on the posts. A little bigger hook, or some sort of metal bracket, would be nice, to give a sense of a more secure latch. Still, you're counting on the fence never being touched, so it's not a big problem.<br /><br />The bag for the kit is amazing. Everything fits inside beautifully, with thoughtful pockets - even a special pocket for the instructions. It is easy to carry and extremely organized. I was very impressed to see the thought and effort put into the bag, which makes the kit much easier to use and deal with than just a pile of fence parts. The bag is big enough that there is room for extra items in both the long post compartment and the smaller bag section.<br /><br />This is a very nice and handy kit to have around if you have quiet horses that respect electric fence."

Upon opening the package I was happy with the portability of the carrying bag, and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is. It's a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out, or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses. Once set up, it won't hold more than two of our horses comfortably. I don't think we'd ever try and manage to get 4 inside like the product advertises!<br /><br />The instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it. I can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well (such as alpacas), but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them.  The step in posts are fantastically designed, the overall design makes the fence very versatile, setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an go.<br /><br />We're very happy with it's design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system, I think!

And I have never been happy hobbling my horse - I'd rather she could escape from a dangerous situation, and something unpredictable is far more likely to happen on the trail than at home. Sooo - here we have this device that is compact and weighs only 15 pounds, thus is easy to pack for trail rides. And since it operates on easily-obtainable D cells, no problem being ""off the grid"".<br /><br />The Fi-Shock HC-100 Portable Paddock showed up in a nice durable red Cordura nylon case. The long part contains eight molded, reinforced plastic stakes with foot push tabs to make it easy to get the metal spikes at the bottom, into the ground. Their working height seems to be just about 3 feet. Multiple slots allow a variety of configurations in set-up.<br /><br />A smaller bag attaches to the pole bag with snaps. It contains 100' of conductive tape on a reel (no, I don't know why the product description says 200'), the transformer of nicely molded, durable-looking green plastic, a transformer stand to be tamped into the ground, a shoulder strap, and two D cell batteries which I promptly put in a safer place so they couldn't accidentally contact conductive material and discharge.<br /><br />This proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall brush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape. Properly set up, the paddock's batteries did not drain. Of course I carried extras. I also chose to guy the corners which I am used to with tents. Of course I had to bring extra rope and tent stakes for that purpose. No problem.<br /><br />This worked... for ONE not-huge horse who is trained to electric fences, so she doesn't challenge them. Sure, any beast of her size could easily break out, but I'd want her to if in danger. No, I can't see how the stated 4 or 5 horses could be contained in this enclosure. But this a viable solution on the trail, for my mare."

They are just as delectable as ... well... any popular chocolate-sandwich-with-cream-center-cookie you can think of :)  When you compare them, they are slightly larger in serving size (2g bigger), and still they have about 10 fewer calories, the same fat, sugar, and carb content, but 25% less saturated fat, three times the fiber, and are MUCH more nutritious (loads of vitamins, minerals, etc). Plus, you don't HAVE to eat 3 cookies, you can just have one or two (good luck).  Everyone who has come to my house has asked to try one, and they went crazy for them.  If you are craving something sweet after a meal and still want to put good things into your body, you will absolutely love these cookies. Delicious to munch and no weird after-taste whatsoever (unlike the WhoNu chocolate chip cookies).  Just sweet, chocolatey, Oreo-esque yumminess.<br /><br />I will say, though, that I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why they're so expensive on Amazon. Maybe because they're not in every grocery store yet, so, when combined with shipping, Amazon can get away with charging a little more?  Who knows. I know I bought them here for convenience, and I'm so glad I got three boxes.  I know you can find them in ShopRite or WalMart for around $3.<br /><br />Wherever you end up getting them, enjoy!

True, they have almost the same sugar, fat and carb amounts of the best-known name brand of these cookies; but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other brand. This is a plus!<br /><br />They're really good as a snack and it's hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies; but I guess I'm allowed an occasional guilty pleasure! As I write this they are a bit too expensive on this website; try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your door.<br /><br />Overall, these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are the best!

But then I got a little tired of them.  They have a bit of a gritty texture, and they don't taste the way you hope they will when thinking of an Oreo.  They are worth eating if you have a bad craving, but I can't eat more than one or two.  The different taste gets to me.  There may be an ingredient in them that doesn't agree with me.  They contain vegetable oils, just like Oreos do.  Palm oil is in practically everything these days because it is cheap for companies to use.  When I eat it, it leaves a thick, greasy film in my mouth and throat.  Store-made cake frostings, cookies, cupcakes...anything that has it leaves that feeling, and I don't like it at all.  Some are worse than others, making it hard to swallow.  This happened when I ate a double-stuf chocolate WhoNu cookie.  Palm oil is listed as an ingredient.  I stopped buying them and the regular chocolate.  I only get the vanilla version.  They contain palm oil as well, but I'm guessing it is less because they don't bother me.  I like them much better.  It's weird because I like chocolate sandwich cookies better than vanilla ones in general.  But with Whonu, the vanilla wins for me.<br /><br />Yesterday I had a craving for a chocolate sandwich cookie, and I bought Oreos.  Even Oreos don't taste as good as they used to.  I guess since the trans fat change in products.  The WhoNu cookies have the extra vitamins and nutrients, and less sodium.  But the Oreos have a better flavor.  The difference in fat content doesn't seem to be very different.  Actually, the difference in sodium doesn't seem very significant, either.  I decided I'd rather eat a few Oreos than a few of these.  It's something you have to decide for yourself when comparing the pros and cons.

I wrote three sort of similar reviews for this brand of cookies.  This review is for those who are looking for a cookie because they want a cookie, not vitamins or fiber or whatever.  I bought them because I have a sweet tooth and wanted some cookies and these were on sale plus I had a coupon.  I purchased the crispy cookies, the vanilla sandwich cookies and the chocolate sandwich cookies.  I thought they were all very good and would not hesitate to buy them again. I found these cookies to taste very good, very similar to an oreo except that the cookie part was a little thinner and crispier than an Oreo.  Oreos might taste a wee bit better but then they're Oreos, come on.  A cool fact I found out when I was looking up ingredients for Whonu Chocolate Sandwich cookies and Oreos, the first ingredient in regular Oreos is sugar and in these cookies and most other sandwich cookies I think it is flour.  I found that interesting for some reason.  Anyway, out of the three flavors I tried this was my least favorite but only because I like vanilla ALOT, these are still great tasting chocolate sandwich cookies!

I usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. It used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky.

The Honey Nut flavor has been my favorite since they came out and the thought of caramel was quite appealing.<br /><br />The first few spoonfuls seemed quite yummy.  But the more I ate, the less I enjoyed it.  The caramel flavor seemed a bit off to me or maybe it was that these are more corn than oat so the flavor was different from that as well.  (Oats are the third ingredient after corn and sugar; I thought Cheerios were always oat cereals.) All things considered (especially price), I'll stick with Honey Nut.<br /><br />They tasted pretty good just plain from the box so I think I'll save them for when I want a slightly sweet snack but not too sugary.  I'll pour out a handful and eat them like a toddler!<br /><br />I expected these to be more sugary than the Honey Nut but these have 6 grams of sugar per serving compared to 9 grams for the Honey Nut.

I've noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it.<br /><br />Now, the bad news: this coffee is kinda bad.  I should note, this isn't the opinion of a coffee snob:  while I like a good cup of Peet's Coffee as much as the next guy, I'm a-okay with a batch of Folger's or the basic house brand of whatever chain store I happen to be shopping in.  I'm usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isn't highway robbery.<br /><br />Alas, for all of its low acidity (and decent price), this coffee ain't that pleasant kick start.  There's an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe - other than to say that Puroast doesn't really taste like French Roast coffee.  Even doctored up with cinnamon and milk, the unpleasant flavor remains.<br /><br />So yes, this coffee is effective, if you absolutely need to have coffee.

Here again, I think you really can't beat the quality with a really fair price that Hodgson provides.  It seems to me that they have expended great effort to have the best product they can produce & the best shipping available for their customers.<br /><br />Buy with great confidence based on my experiences with them during the last 2-3 years.  I hope this helps decision making."

The potato bread mix actually rose and stuck to the top of my bread making machine and became entangled in the mixing blade, so it was difficult to remove.  Otherwise, the bread tasted great!!  The Rye bread was also delicious.  It didn'nt rise as much, and I had no trouble removing it from the bread machine.  The rye loaf was much denser than the potato bread loaf.<br /><br />The only drawback to purchasing these products online was the shipping costs.  I have since found out that I can purchase the same brand products at HEB and Kroger grocery stores, and will not order online, again.

I can run my well water from my tap and get the same results, it's awful.  I normally use Brita filters with the pitcher provided and when I heat or even boil the water the tea stays clear. This Means no bacteria have been killed off by the heating process, it means you'd be better off drinking the Brita water!!!!!! I gave this bottle water a chance I got a second case and the same thing happen. I wouldn't drink this water straight from the bottle ever. As a nurse I know it's not a good idea.  If you ever want to know if water is good or clear of bacteria/impurities you can make Lipton tea hot then, as it cools down IF the tea turns very cloudy it has dead bacteria and other impurities. I used the ice cubes made from this bottled water as well, so nothing is different except the tea.  Tried the Brita water and Brita made ice cubes and it remained clear.  Sorry not a good review from me I am afraid.<br /><br /> I was very disappointed as I thought ""yeah"" a bottled water I can carry to work, so I am not force to pay $1.50 for a bottle from the machine, but it turn out not to be so.<br /><br />Okay, so I tried another company on this website Nestles which in my region came as Deer Park.

These are a very different beast from the American-style rice cakes that most people associate with the name--as other reviews suggest, these aren't quite so air-filled or crumbly, having more the density and thickness of a cracker or crisp flatbread. But unlike those, these are gluten-free, oil-free, unsalted, and contain only one ingredient: 100% puffed brown rice. They've got a nice light crunch that makes them good for snacking, but they're a lot healthier than chips or crackers, and the brown rice is definitely preferable to a more processed white rice cake if you're mindful of blood sugar impact. They're also great for the occasional mild tummy upset, since they're light and bland and don't require the preparation of other bland foods.<br /><br />Try them with hummus! My personal favorite: peanut butter, jam, and a sprinkling of chia seeds. Yum!

I don't eat wheat, it packs the pounds on me around my middle. Most breads have wheat or if they are gluten free, they cost way too much.<br /><br />I have eaten all kinds of rice cakes. I have found that most will break apart if you're spreading a nut butter on them. Not these! Also there are generally 13 rice cakes in a pkg of round regular rice cakes... this package of rice cakes has 27 pieces in each bag. Also, it's much like consuming a slice of bread without the crusts and they are nice and thin so you don't eat too much of a good thing.<br /><br />Try these if you're dissatisfied with regular rice cakes or if you must have gluten free bread!! I don't believe you will be sorry and Amazon's price is so good and FREE shipping... though the box is sort of big, it's pretty light and stores easily away. I live alone and I'm on my next to last pkg from my first case and they are not at all stale. I stored them in my cool dark garage in their original cardboard box.<br /><br />Also they are made in Belgium if that helps anyone. The packaging is air tight and they come 12 pkgs in a box and are in the perfect sized box, and mine arrived without a sign of any damage and I have yet to find even a single cracked rice cake! They are rather neutral in their taste... I make a special butter spread that I like on them real well. You take equal parts of room temperature butter, olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth. You can refrigerate this, it sets up but doesn't get hard so it is always spreadable and tastes really good! I use organic butter, olive oil and filtered water, but you don't have. This spread is so good and I believe it's better for you than straight butter.<br /><br />Also, I only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich, as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of bread just doesn't seem to work as well. But a single sided sandwhich with these rice cakes is very enjoyable!<br /><br />Hope this helps you decide to try them. Everyone I've given some to, have had only good comments about them.

Unfortunately not for me. A few friends of mine that tried it and said,""It wasn't bad."" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments.<br />If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.

The Cafe Escapes or whatever the brand name is tastes very watered down and artificial, while this one tastes thicker and milkier.  I love the dark chocolate flavor, although if I didn't know it wasn't dark I probably couldn't have told the difference between it and a regular cup of cocoa.  I will stick with the flavor just because it will probably be richer than the milk chocolate option.  These are such a hit at my house when the weather is cool.  Everyone always wants hot chocolate!<br /><br />Something to note on this is that these work much better when used with about 6 oz per k-cup.  I use 2 k-cups per mug and the flavor is much better than when I try one (too watery).

It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon.

Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.<br /><br />I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  I've dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  Pretty good. Pretty cheap. Pretty hard to get at times.

I am a Cuisinart Keurig owner with two teens that love to drink hot cocoa and cider pretty much year round.<br /><br />Price point: The price for these at the store ( exact brand ) is almost triple of what we pay here for the same amount, with subscribe and save this makes these quite affordable for my family use. In comparison to other more expensive brands it's a great bargain without sacrificing quality over quantity.<br /><br />Flavor wise: My kids love it, and have already asked me to purchase more. My daughter says that the peppermint is right on and not too weak even if using a larger cup. I love the dark chocolate in my coffee to make a mocha ( 10oz coffee to 4 oz chocolate ) and it's much better than some other brands that I have tried in the past.<br /><br />Overall impression:  Great value, good flavor, excellent price point I will be purchasing more.

My first ""Grove Square"" purchase.  Great for the family's occasional cocoa desire.  Being a K-Cup it's fast and easy.  Was a little worried the cocoa might leave some after taste in my coffee, so far so good.  Great cup of dark, rich cocoa.  Maybe could taste a LITTLE better if it was from a gourmet brand you mix yourself with steamed milk.  The ease and simplicity, and lack of clean up, make this a better option for me.  Will order again.  Nice to see it on subscribe and save."

When that happens I used to put on the kettle and heat up the water, then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir, and stir, and stir.  And after all that stirring, I'd still get little lumps in my cocoa.  With the K-cups, I get smooth rich cocoa with NO lumps and NO clean-up.  Easy and yummy!<br /><br />Please note: THESE ARE NOT SUGAR-FREE.  The very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and I did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients.

I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste.

I tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help.  The only reason I gave these k-cups 2 stars is because my boyfriend can ""tolerate"" them, but I don't trust him because he'll eat just about anything.  In his opinion they are ""not that good"" but he will still drink the mug.<br /><br />From what I've read of other hot chocolate k-cups, you'd be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way!"

I will definitely be ordering it again. That being said, I dislike hot chocolate made completely of water, so I do add a splash of Half and Half to my cup when I make this. Thus, I didn't want to give it a 5 star rating since I do doctor my cup up a bit at home (otherwise I would have). However, I won't even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water, I use 100% milk usually for those and they still don't measure up to this product from Grove Square. So, the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes. I do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that I have ever tried at home. Compared to the Swiss Miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it. I'm a big fan!

While this milk chocolate k-cup is pretty cheap $12.95 per 24 (54 cents per count) but it is not good. It tasted like watered down chocolate (as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate/cacao for that matter). This thing is sweet tho, in fact kinda too sweet for my taste (i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar/sweetener). I thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so I lowered the cup size from 8 ounce to 6 ounce on my Keurig brewer and it's the same thing.

I just got them last week and have had a few cups since then.  I'm using 8 ounces of water to prepare the cocoa.  I thought they tasted pretty good - reasonably chocolaty and smooth.<br /><br />They were sweet, but not overly so, and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box.  60 calories - hey, not too bad!  It wasn't until now that I came back to place a review and I read the most recent reviews from others did I realize they use artificial sweetener.  Honestly, if I hadn't read it I would have never known - I didn't detect anything that gave me the hint when I drank it.<br /><br />I think if you like a quick cocoa on the run you'll be happy enough with these K-cups.  Are they as good as a Swiss Miss packet from Costco?  Maybe not, but in my office I don't want to deal with getting powder on the counters and needing a spoon to get things mixed.  You'll sacrifice a little for the convenience, but to me it's well worth it.

I've tried some other chocolate K-cups and had given up on them since they all seemed pretty watery.  If I can taste water I don't consider it real hot chocolate.  I was pleasantly surprised that this tastes much better than the others I've tried.  (I must admit there are many I haven't tried, but I don't really feel like making a big scientific study of it.)

Still, I don't drink hot chocolate that much, so I think I'll survive.  I'll copy the ingredient label here for those concerned plus a few items from the nutrition info:<br /><br />Calories 60, from fat 20.  Trans Fat 0g. Sodium 200mg. Sugars 6g.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: sugar, glucose syrup solids, cocoa (processed with alkali), partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (may contain coconut, soybean, sunflower, palm and/or canola), modified whey, maltodextrin, salt, natural and artificial flavors, cellulose gum, sodium caseinate, cornstarch, lactose, dipotassium phosphate, sucralose, mono- and diglycerides, silicon dioxide, soy lecithin, artificial color. [Contains milk and soy.]<br /><br />(I always hate seeing artificial coloring in ""dark"" chocolate products.)<br /><br />If I had hot chocolate every day I would consider making it from scratch with more cocoa and fewer chemicals, but since I enjoy the convenience of having it nearly instantly from my Keurig on the occasional whim, I'll just keep a box of these K-cups on hand.  I highly recommend it for the taste, it isn't easy finding good hot chocolate."

I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa. I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled. So I guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes.

I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!<br /><br />I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.)<br /><br />It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)<br /><br />If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products.

If you read all the reviews on every product you'll discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly spotless reputation.  So I decided that even with some bad reviews I'd try this one since it has a lot of good reviews.  I'm just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread.  Some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute, or some such thing.  All I can tell you is I must have under-achieving taste buds because all I can taste is yummy hot chocolate.  My family burned through the first box and I just ordered two more.  If you don't like this I feel sorry for you. Better to have numb taste buds I guess.  Enjoy.

The Grove Square Hot Chocolate is far superior.  I have so far brewed it on 6oz and 8oz with good flavor at both sizes.  The flavor is rich and it leaves no residue in the bottom of the kcup (the other brand does, maybe I got a bad batch?).  Overall, I will happily buy this one again.

Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).<br /><br />One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some.

After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again.

I really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. It is very satisfying to me. I'm a single gal who doesn't really cook & am often in a hurry for my next meal, and I find that this soup really hits the spot. Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.<br /><br />Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :)<br /><br />One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.) Oh well, can't have it all....

And being heirloom, I believe you can also save some back to plant, if you have the climate for growing them.  (Unfortunately, I don't.)<br /><br />Out of all the ones I've tried, we like the Borlotti best - they cook up plump and will hold their shape, with a creamy interior.  They're fantastic for Mexican-style beans - frijoles borrachos, refried, whatever you like.  And I've also cooked them with ham hocks/garlic/onions etc. for a delightful bowl of beans.<br /><br />This particular assortment doesn't have the Borlotti beans but you could always add them to your order!

Then came the rude surprise - Grapefruit flavor is not a common sight on TicTac stands - anywhere.<br /><br />I finally settled on this purchase as the only way to maintain a steady supply.  This flavor of TicTac is best used as a ""chaser"", following a heavy-duty breath freshening from TicTac Power Mint, the blue color.  Not only is Power Mint effective, it also numbs out my tongue for several minutes.  A follow-up with a single Grapefruit restores my mouth to normality.<br /><br />I rate Grapefruit as the best flavor, with Watermelon and the new Strawberry Foelds close seconds.  In general any flavor TicTac is effective breath-freshening, but Grapefruit is truly addicting.  TicTac settles the issue that the tongue is a major contributor to sour breath."

Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!

I worked at a pet store for about four years. Our number one recommendations on foods were Natural Balance and Wellness- two EXCEPTIONAL foods that are pretty expensive.  But for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog, those brands can cripple your budget.  So when I would get customers who absolutely LOVED their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks, I recommended Diamond.  Diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like Purina and Iams, but contains ONLY natural, healthy ingredients.  Just remember, the less garbage you feed your dog (by-products, fillers) the less your dog uses the bathroom- AND they stay fuller, longer!

We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say ""Natural"" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!?"

DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much ""Doctoring"" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products. Try their Blueberry Muffin Mix and hope that one day Amazon will carry a wider array of their Gluten Free offerings as many are very, very good."

I could go on but you get the idea.  In order to use this mix I had to make substitutions and was delighted with what tastes like a treat to me.  Aside from the fact that I don't have to measure out three kinds of flour to make something from scratch, the best thing about these muffins is the texture.  Texture is a challenge absent gluten, sugar, and eggs, and I found this to be very much like how I remember muffins.  The bits of dried apple make these chewy and kind of weirdly so.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.

Like all GF products, they are pretty dense in the end, but the apples make for a nice addition and they fill you up. Personally, I added a bit more ""sugar"" (xylitol) than the recipe calls for.

Given it was a good price, I figured Id give it a shot.... before I whipped up a batch I figured Id do a little investigating to see if there was any input/ suggestions on the mix. WOW. Is everyone using the same mix or what? Reviews from ""its great"" to ""its horrible""..like a total 50/50 split. SOOOooo, before  I wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself, I figured Id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix, all on its own.... ummmmm, yeah. It TOTALLY has a pretty strong bitter after taste. :/ And , like another reviewer, I had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener (I dont like things very sweet, at all) but its DEF not. As I re read the ingredients I realized there isnt ANY sugar/sweetener in this mix so, youd def NEED to add sweetening. But, overall, I dont even plan on taking this mix that far. Im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away. Thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away..... Id strongly suggest avoiding this mix.... I hope the company works on this mix.

I also made them while on vacation at my sister's house, and her family loved them.  I just got back from a Bible study full of pretty picky eaters, and they all said they were good.  They're usually pretty honest about how the gluten-free food I take tastes, even telling me once that some store-bought cookies I took tasted like cardboard.<br /><br />I did notice a VERY SLIGHT bitter aftertaste, but it was not too bad.  I think next time I make these I may take the advice of one other reviewer and add a grated apple for that extra touch.  Oh, and I only added 3 TBS of sugar and think they were really good, as did everyone else who ate them.  I'm sure that if you add even more sugar, the slight aftertaste could disappear altogether.<br /><br />I just went to the Hodgson Mills website and saw that they did recently change the formulation to this mix, so maybe that improved the aftertaste.  This mix does not have garbanzo flour.  They use sorghum instead, now.  I did not make these as muffins.  I found that one box is perfect for 2 mini loaves, which I prefer to muffins.  Very good.

Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.  Good price, but definitely test one box first to see if you like them.

It finally dawned on me that due to throwing up bile in the am was that the food was not staying with her.  I even tried feeding her before going to bed at night and still did not work.  I tried Evo and I could not believe the change.  She does not get us up at night to go outside.  She was having 3-4 bowel movements every day and now she has 1 or sometimes 2.

The first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it- and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he stares at it hard enough!  I agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up.  He is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him, although I wish the price were a little more reasonable.

Before I started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food. Although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price! You feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks. His skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too. The only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools-but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted. All in all if you can afford to feed them EVO its well worth the investment!

We hated the time it took to heat up the water,and the mess the dry mix sometimes makes. We saw that the Keurig coffee maker did other things like hot chocolate and tea, liked that it was almost instant hot water, and bought one. I ordered another brand of hot chocolate k-cup, and absolutely hated it. It had a weird almost metallic taste that was not sweet or chocolately. I was worried I wasted my money on a maker I would never use. I decided to try another brand and purchased the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa, and we absolutely love it! It is sweet and chocolately without being too bitter(which is why I originally steered away from the dark chocolate). I fully recommend this product!!

I'd love to soak a chicken in it, as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets.<br /><br />These big bottles won't last and I'll be back for more, fer shure.  Absolutely more than worth worth the little price, this stuff should be standard in every home, along with plumbing.<br /><br />And my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you.

I've kept open bottles in my refrigerator for months without any problem.<br /><br />If you have never tried this, the sauce is thicker than Heinz Ketchup so you can slowly add sweetness and heat until its just right for you. Another way to use this is on steamed vegetables and you can add peanuts or sliced almonds just before serving.

Cut your usual fryer in quarters, cook it slowly over charcoal or quickly in a hot oven, and then brush it generously with ""sweet chili sauce"" and cook it just a few minutes more.

Sometimes they trot alongside inter-city buses as they pull into stations, and sell chicken through the windows. Don't be squeamish! This is a treat you'll remember.

I purchased the 12 oz. bottle at a local store, and I must say it's one of the most addicting sauces I have ever had! I'm a pretty picky eater, and a vegetarian at that, so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one. This sauce is ALMOST perfect. It's very sweet, and has a strong garlic taste at first. It isn't as thick as the Red Hot brand, which I didn't like much at all (thick, not as flavorful, way too chunky). This sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. My son loves spicy food just like his mommy. Another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons, and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber, too! The only thing I have a hard time with, and this is just a personal issue, is the texture of the red chilli. They tastes great, but they have a very thin, clear ""skin"" that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. Not all, just some. I get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. Still, I eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces I have EVER tasted! I would recommend anyone to try this sauce first, and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. This sauce is amazing. It was about $1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or can't find it near you, know that I would pay Amazon's price for it any day! Buy this sauce. I don't care where or how, just buy it. You'll fall in love!"
